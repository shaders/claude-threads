**Bring Claude Code to your team.** Run Claude Code on your machine, share it live in Mattermost. Colleagues can watch, collaborate, and run their own sessions—all from chat.

> _Think of it as screen-sharing for AI pair programming, but everyone can type._

## Features

- **Real-time streaming** - Claude's responses stream live to chat
- **Multiple agents** - Run Claude Code or OpenAI Codex per session (`!agent codex`)
- **Multi-instance** - Connect to multiple Mattermost servers simultaneously
- **Concurrent sessions** - Each thread gets its own Claude session, persisted across bot restarts
- **Collaboration** - `!invite` teammates to participate; they get added as `Co-Authored-By:` trailers on Claude's commits
- **Permission modes** - Three-way control over Claude's tool-use: `default` (every action prompts for 👍/✅/👎 approval via emoji), `auto` (Claude's classifier auto-approves low-risk; high-risk still prompts — recommended), or `bypass` (no prompts, all tools allowed). Set via config, `--permission-mode` CLI flag, or in-session with `!permissions default|auto|bypass`.
- **Claude posts back to chat** - Claude can call `send_file` to drop screenshots, generated PDFs, plots, or audio directly into the thread, and `read_post` to follow a Mattermost permalink the user shares
- **Git worktrees** - Isolate Claude's changes in a branch with `!worktree feature/foo`; supports `list`, `switch`, `remove`, `cleanup`, `off`
- **File attachments** - Drop images, PDFs, archives, or any file into the chat; Claude reads them from disk via its own `Read`/Bash tools (100 MB cap)
- **Chrome automation** - Optional integration with Claude in Chrome for web tasks
- **Multi-account Claude (opt-in)** - Round-robin sessions across multiple Claude subscriptions or API keys with automatic rate-limit cooldown — see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#claude-accounts-optional-multi-account-mode)
- **Auto-update** - Bot checks npm for new versions and offers to restart; `!update now` / `!update defer` controls the timing

## Quick Start

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install (pick one)
bun install -g claude-threads   # with Bun (recommended)
npm install -g claude-threads   # with Node

# Run the setup wizard
cd /your/project
claude-threads
```

The **interactive setup wizard** will guide you through everything:

- Configure Claude Code CLI (if needed)
- Set up your Mattermost bot
- Test credentials and permissions
- Get you up and running in minutes

**Need help with platform setup?** See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for Mattermost bot creation.

### Prerequisites

- **Bun 1.2.21+** or **Node 20+** - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Claude Code CLI working** - test with `claude --version` (needs API key or subscription)

### Use

Mention the bot in your chat:

```
@claude help me fix the bug in src/auth.ts
```

### Using OpenAI Codex (optional)

Sessions run Claude Code by default. With the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed (`codex --version`, logged in via `codex login`), you can run a session with Codex instead:

```
@claude !agent codex help me fix the bug in src/auth.ts
```

Or make Codex the default in `~/.config/claude-threads/config.yaml`:

```yaml
agent: codex          # default agent for new sessions (claude | codex)
codex:                # optional codex settings
  model: gpt-5.5-codex
  # path: /custom/path/to/codex
  # sandbox: workspace-write   # or danger-full-access (with skipPermissions)
```

Codex sessions support streaming, interactive command approvals (👍 ✅ 👎), task lists, interrupts, and resume after restart. Claude-specific features (plugins, Chrome automation, plan mode) are unavailable with Codex. Title/tag suggestions still use the Claude CLI when present.

## Interactive Controls

**Permission approval** - When Claude wants to execute a tool:

- 👍 Allow this action
- ✅ Allow all future actions
- 👎 Deny

**Plan approval** - When Claude creates a plan:

- 👍 Approve and start
- 👎 Request changes

**Questions** - React with 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ to answer multiple choice

**Session control** - ⏸️ to interrupt, ❌ or 🛑 to stop, ↩️ to resume a timed-out session

## File Attachments

Drop any file into the chat (image, PDF, archive, source, log, you name it). The bot saves it to a per-thread directory and prepends the path to your message; Claude reads it with its own `Read` tool (full multimodal for images and PDFs) or processes it via Bash. Single 100 MB cap per file. Need to extract a zip? Claude runs `unzip` itself.

Going the other way, Claude can post files back into the thread (screenshots, generated PDFs, plots, MP3s) by calling the `send_file` MCP tool. Path is validated against the session working directory; auto-approved so the user doesn't have to 👍 every screenshot.

## Collaboration

```
!invite @colleague    # Let them participate
!kick @colleague      # Remove access
```

Unauthorized users can request message approval from the session owner with a 👍 reaction.

Invited collaborators are added as `Co-Authored-By:` trailers on any commits Claude makes during the session. Each collaborator runs `!github-email <their-noreply-address>` once (find yours at <https://github.com/settings/emails>) and the bot remembers it across sessions.

## Sharing Links With Claude

Paste a Mattermost permalink in the thread and Claude can resolve it to the post body (and optional thread context) via the `read_post` MCP tool, instead of asking you to copy-paste. Auto-approved; scoped to channels the bot can already see.

## Git Worktrees

Keep your main branch clean while Claude works on features:

```
@claude on branch feature/add-auth implement user authentication
```

Or mid-session: `!worktree feature/add-auth`

## Access Control

Restrict who can use the bot during setup (or reconfigure later with `claude-threads --setup`).

Leave the allowed users list empty to let anyone in the channel use the bot (be careful!)

## Updates

```bash
npm install -g claude-threads

The bot checks for updates automatically and notifies you when new versions are available.
