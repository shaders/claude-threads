## Global Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `workingDir` | Default working directory for Claude | Current directory |
| `chrome` | Enable Chrome integration | `false` |
| `worktreeMode` | Git worktree mode: `off`, `prompt`, or `require` | `prompt` |
| `respondOnlyWhenMentioned` | Start new threads in quiet mode, where the bot only replies to messages that @mention it. Users can still toggle per-thread with `!mentions`. | `false` |
| `arbiter` | Completion watchdog. After each turn: reminds the agent about external deliveries it forgot (a `send_dm`/`send_file` the user asked for, max 2 reminders then a warning post), and nudges it to continue when it stalls asking "should I proceed?" (max 3 nudges per session; genuine blocking questions are left to humans). Uses out-of-band Haiku calls. | `true` |
| `arbiterPolicy` | What the arbiter does when a session is parked waiting on a human and nobody answers — see [Arbiter policy](#arbiter-policy) below. | see below |
| `arbiterChain` | Cross-bot review chain: MR → review requested → reviewer answers → approval in GitLab → result handed back → human told. See [Review chain](#review-chain) below. Needs `reviewPing.botName` to know who the reviewer is. | on |
| `returnDelivery` | Guaranteed reply to the requester's thread. When an incoming message carries a reply-to directive with a permalink ("отвечай мне в тред: `<url>`" / "reply in the thread: `<url>`"), the bot records that thread as the session's return address and — once the session has been quiet for 90s — posts the final assistant message there itself, mentioning the requester and linking back to its own thread. Purely deterministic, no LLM. If the agent already posted to that thread on its own, the bot stays out of the way. | `true` |
| `docsPing` | Tells a docs bot about shipped changes — see [Docs ping](#docs-ping) below. | off |
| `teammates` | Other bots this bot can hand work to (`[{name, channelId}]`). Backs the `send_to_teammate` tool and the docs ping, which route through one shared rule: a teammate who holds sessions in the current channel is addressed in the current thread; anyone else is reached in their own channel with a link back. Without it `send_to_teammate` reports an unknown teammate. | none |

### Arbiter policy

When an agent asks something and nobody replies, the session used to sit there
forever: a pending question is exactly the case the arbiter refused to touch,
on the reasoning that "a human should answer this". In an unattended channel
that is indistinguishable from the task dying.

So the wait now has a clock. After `waitTimeoutMs` of silence a judge decides
whether the prompt genuinely needs a person. Routine, reversible choices
(send the MR for review, pick between equivalent options, continue agreed
work) get answered by the arbiter, announced in the thread and reversible by a
reply. Anything destructive, costly, irreversible, or a real product call gets
escalated to the humans instead — a `@mention` ping carrying the question and
repeated with doubling backoff.

```yaml
arbiterPolicy:
  autoAnswer: true            # answer routine prompts; false = only ever ping
  waitTimeoutMs: 600000       # 10 min of silence before stepping in
  escalateIntervalMs: 1800000 # 30 min between pings, doubling each time
  maxEscalations: 3           # then stop nagging
  escalateTo: [maxk]          # defaults to whoever started the session
  judgeModel: sonnet          # haiku is cheaper but worse at this call
```

`escalateTo` matters for bot-to-bot work: without it the ping goes to the
agent that handed the task over, which may be just as stuck. Naming a human
routes it to someone who can actually unblock things.

### Review chain

The steps around a merge request span two bots on two hosts, and each of them has
exactly one party that can perform it. The chain records who owes which step and
chases it — our own agent with an injected instruction, another bot with a mention
in the same thread (the only thing that wakes its session), a person with an
@mention once reminders are spent.

Closure is an event, never a deadline:

| Step | Owner | Closed by |
|------|-------|-----------|
| review requested | our agent | the review ping landing, or the agent's own delivery call |
| reviewer answers | reviewer bot | any post or post edit of theirs in this thread |
| approval | whoever reviewed | an approval (or a merge) seen through `glab` |
| result handed back | the reviewer's agent | the hand-back delivery |
| human told | our agent | the bot's own "готово" mention to the requester |

The only model call in the chain is one haiku classification of the finished
review — clean or changes needed — because that decides whether an approval is
owed at all. Everything else is a fact.

```yaml
arbiterChain:
  enabled: true
  awakeSilenceMs: 120000   # 2 min of silence = the owner never woke up
  workSilenceMs: 300000    # 5 min of silence after they HAVE shown up
  maxReminders: 2          # then a person is told instead
```

**The reviewer's name is read from `reviewPing.botName`**, and it should also
appear in `teammates[]` — that list is what classifies who posted as a bot rather
than a person. The chain tolerates a mismatch (the configured reviewer counts as a
bot either way), but every other cross-bot feature routes through `teammates`, so
keep them in step.

Both numbers are **silence windows measured from the owner's last sign of life**,
not deadlines on the task: a reviewer visibly working on a long diff is never
interrupted, while one whose process died is noticed in minutes. Post edits count
as signs of life on purpose — a bot mid-task rewrites one rolling tool line
instead of posting again, so without edits a busy teammate is indistinguishable
from a dead one.

Two shortcuts skip the reminder ladder entirely, because in both cases nudging
cannot work: a reviewer whose bot announced a rate limit in the thread, and a
reviewer who holds no session in this channel at all. Both go straight to a human.

Nonsense values are clamped with a warning rather than accepted: a
`workSilenceMs` below `awakeSilenceMs` inverts the design (a reviewer who *is*
working would be interrupted sooner than one who never woke up), and
`maxReminders: 0` would escalate to a person on the first tick.

After a restart, silence is measured from the moment the process came up, never
from the stamps in the restored ledger — the downtime was ours, not the owner's.

`!arbiter` lists what the chain is still waiting on in a thread; `health.json`
carries `chainOpen` and `chainStuck` so a stuck chain is visible on the status
board without reading threads.

### Docs ping

For fleets with a dedicated documentation bot. When a session opens an MR, the
bot decides whether the change is something the docs team needs to hear about
and, if so, posts a summary into the docs bot's channel itself.

The split matters: the **trigger** and the **delivery** are code — a session
either has an MR or it doesn't, and the post either happened or it didn't. Only
the judgement ("does this touch documentation?") is a model call, made
out-of-band once per session. Asking the agent to remember this last step
doesn't work: forty minutes into a task, it doesn't.

```yaml
docsPing:
  enabled: true
  channelId: C0123DOCS       # docs bot's channel — required
  botName: april             # used in the message and for the self-ping guard
  judgeModel: sonnet
  quiescenceMs: 120000       # quiet period before the ping fires
```

Nothing fires for a session without an MR, the docs bot never pings itself
(guarded by both name and channel), and if the agent already posted to that
channel — because a human asked it to — the bot stays out of the way.

## Platform Settings

### Mattermost

| Setting | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier for this platform |
| `type` | Yes | Must be `mattermost` |
| `displayName` | No | Human-readable name |
| `url` | Yes | Mattermost server URL |
| `token` | Yes | Bot access token |
| `channelId` | Yes | Channel to listen in |
| `botName` | No | Mention name (default: `claude-code`) |
| `allowedUsers` | No | List of usernames who can use the bot |
| `skipPermissions` | No | Auto-approve actions (default: `false`) |
| `sessionHeader` | No | Per-thread header visibility: `full` (default) / `minimal` (status bar only) / `hidden` (no header post) |
| `respondOnlyWhenMentioned` | No | Seed new sessions on THIS platform with quiet mode, overriding the bot-wide default. Required for a shared channel where several bots hold sessions in one thread — without it each bot reads the others' output as a reply to itself and they answer each other indefinitely. |
| `autoIncludeThreadContext` | No | Silently fold up to N previous thread messages into the first prompt when a session starts mid-thread, instead of asking. The other half of a shared channel: a joining bot always starts mid-thread, so the prompt would fire on every handoff and its timeout defaults to *no* context, leaving it blind to the task it was called about. Capped (e.g. `20`) so a long thread isn't dragged in whole. |
| `teammatesPresent` | No | Names of teammates that also hold sessions in THIS channel. A handoff to one of them stays in the current thread; anyone else goes to their own channel. Property of the channel, hence per-platform. |
| `stickyMessage` | No | Channel sticky visibility: `full` (default) / `minimal` (status bar only) / `hidden` (no sticky, no bumping) |


### Quieting the bot's overhead messages

Both the per-thread session header and the channel sticky message default to `full` for backward compatibility. To strip them down on a noisy channel, set the per-platform fields in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  - id: mattermost-main
    type: mattermost
    # ... credentials ...
    sessionHeader: hidden    # no header post — Claude's reply is the first message in the thread
    stickyMessage: minimal   # one-line status bar at the channel bottom, no sessions list
```

Note: the per-platform `stickyMessage: <mode>` field is distinct from the top-level `Config.stickyMessage: { description, footer }` block, which still customizes the full sticky for platforms not in `hidden` mode.

## Claude Accounts (optional, multi-account mode)

By default every session spawns `claude` with the bot's own `process.env`, so they all share one subscription's token budget. Add a `claudeAccounts` block to spread load across multiple accounts — the bot round-robins new sessions across the pool and automatically skips accounts in rate-limit cooldown. Omit the block entirely to stay in single-account mode (unchanged behavior).

```yaml
claudeAccounts:
  # OAuth accounts — prepare each HOME first with `HOME=<path> claude login`
  - id: primary
    home: /home/bot/.claude-accounts/primary
  - id: backup
    displayName: Backup (Pro)
    home: /home/bot/.claude-accounts/backup

  # API-key billed
  - id: shared-api
    apiKey: sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxx...
```

| Setting | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Stable identifier used in logs, UI, and persisted session state |
| `home` | One of | Alternate `$HOME` containing `.claude/.credentials.json` from a prior `HOME=<path> claude login`. For OAuth Pro/Max subscriptions. Session history also lives here, so resumed sessions pick the same account. |
| `apiKey` | One of | Anthropic API key. Billed against that key; session history stays under the bot's default `HOME`. |
| `displayName` | No | Human-readable label in UI (defaults to `id`) |

Exactly one of `home` or `apiKey` should be set per account. Persisted sessions record which account they ran under and resume on the same one.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MAX_SESSIONS` | Max concurrent sessions | `5` |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | Idle timeout in milliseconds | `1800000` (30 min) |
| `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` | Disable update checks | - |
| `DEBUG` | Enable verbose logging | - |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB` | Strip `ANTHROPIC_*` / `AWS_*_TOKEN` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` / `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` etc. from Bash, hook, and stdio-MCP subprocesses Claude spawns. Bot-specific vars like `PLATFORM_TOKEN` pass through. **Also forces permission mode to `default`** — `--dangerously-skip-permissions` will be rejected. Requires Claude CLI 2.1.83+. | - |

### Forwarded to Claude CLI automatically

The bot sets two tuning flags on the Claude child process when they aren't
already present in the bot's environment:

| Variable | Effect | Requires |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=true` | Caps `--mcp-config` connects at 5s so a slow MCP server never delays startup | Claude CLI 2.1.89+ |
| `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=true` | Opts into 1-hour prompt cache TTL, cutting re-caching cost on long-lived threads | Claude CLI 2.1.108+ |

Export either with a different value in the bot's own env to disable.

## CLI Options

CLI options override config file settings:

```bash
claude-threads [options]

Options:
  --url <url>              Mattermost server URL
  --token <token>          Bot token
  --channel <id>           Channel ID
  --bot-name <name>        Bot mention name (default: claude-code)
  --allowed-users <list>   Comma-separated allowed usernames
  --skip-permissions       Skip permission prompts (auto-approve)
  --no-skip-permissions    Enable permission prompts (override env)
  --chrome                 Enable Chrome integration
  --no-chrome              Disable Chrome integration
  --worktree-mode <mode>   Git worktree mode: off, prompt, require
  --session-header <mode>  Per-thread header: full | minimal | hidden (overrides per-platform config)
  --sticky-message <mode>  Channel sticky: full | minimal | hidden (overrides per-platform config)
  --setup                  Re-run setup wizard
  --debug                  Enable debug logging
  --version                Show version
  --help                   Show help
```

## Session Persistence

Active sessions are saved to `~/.config/claude-threads/sessions.json` and automatically resume after bot restarts.

## Keep-Alive

The bot prevents system sleep while sessions are active (uses `caffeinate` on macOS, `systemd-inhibit` on Linux). Disable with `--no-keep-alive` or `keepAlive: false` in config.
