## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- **Slack support is gone; Mattermost is the only platform.** ~11k lines of Slack client, formatter, permalink resolver, MCP platform API, upload path, mock server and integration fixtures, plus the branches that existed only to choose between two platforms: the `SlackPlatformConfig` type, the onboarding flow and its app-manifest step, the dual `apiConfig` in the MCP child, and the read_post / react_to_post / read_channel_history / search_messages dispatch. **Breaking:** a `config.yaml` carrying a `type: slack` platform now fails at startup with `Unsupported platform type: slack`; remove that entry. The `PlatformClient` / `PlatformFormatter` / `McpPlatformApi` seam is deliberately kept — it is what the tests mock against, and `src/platform/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` still documents adding a platform. Two things fell out with the second platform and are worth knowing: `getThreadLink`'s third parameter and `Session.lastMessageTs` existed only for Slack permalinks (Mattermost ignored them), and the sticky cleanup's `isRecentPost` age filter could only read Slack timestamp ids, so on Mattermost it always returned true — all three are removed rather than left as no-ops. Inbound file-attachment *integration* coverage went with it, since that suite only ever ran against the Slack mock; the Mattermost upload unit tests are untouched. Slack token patterns stay in the bug-report secret scrubber (`xoxb-`/`xoxp-`/`xapp-`/`xoxa-`) — that scrubs arbitrary pasted text and never depended on Slack being a supported platform.

### Fixed
- **The arbiter no longer nags the agent for deliveries the bot already made.** Its obligation ledger is filled from the agent's own tool calls, so once delivery moved into code the arbiter stopped seeing it: the bot posted the answer, then the arbiter reminded the agent about exactly that obligation, and the agent spent a whole turn explaining itself before the reminder was waived — twice the posts, twice the tokens, and the agents started reciting post ids to defend themselves. Everything that delivers on the agent's behalf now reports to the ledger (`noteBotDelivery`): the return delivery, the teammate hand-back and the review ping.

### Fixed
- **A refused MCP call now reaches Claude as an error, so a handoff that was never sent stops counting as delivered.** No tool set `isError`, which read as politeness until `send_to_teammate` joined the arbiter's delivery-tool list: the ledger fulfils an obligation on any non-error `tool_result`, so a *refused* handoff was recorded as a delivered message. The agent was told "not sent", the ledger was told "sent", and the handoff vanished with nobody the wiser — and refusals became routine the moment the channel route was removed, since a teammate who holds no session in this channel now cannot be reached at all. Every tool result whose payload says `ok: false` is flagged as an error now; payloads without an `ok` field (`permission_prompt`'s allow/deny) are untouched. The `send_to_teammate` description, which still promised the channel route and a reply-back link, was corrected to match what the tool does.
- **A request that quotes an earlier delivered answer keeps its own return address.** The `delivered-answer` marker was matched anywhere in the message, so forwarding a previous answer as context — routine when work is passed onward — made the parser treat the whole new request as a delivery and drop its reply-to address. Since `captureReturnAddress` fails silently on a missing URL, the answer would simply never arrive. Only the last non-empty line is checked now, which is where the footer is written. The test that claimed to cover this contained no marker at all and has been replaced with one that does.
- **The arbiter now recognises `send_to_teammate` as a delivery, so it stops demanding one that already happened.** The prompts sanction exactly one cross-bot delivery tool, and it was missing from the arbiter's delivery-tool list — so a bot that obeyed the instruction was never credited for it. The obligation stayed open, the arbiter reminded the agent, the agent delivered again, and around that went: the same hand-back post every three minutes for half an hour overnight, the agent obeying both the prompt and the arbiter while the two disagreed. It is now first in the list.
- **A hand-back to a teammate's own channel is also earned by work now.** The "did this turn do anything" gate only covered the in-thread route, because it was implemented as a side effect of the answer mention — which the channel route doesn't have. So the route that goes to a teammate's channel had no damping at all, which is what let the arbiter loop above keep reposting. The gate is now a route-independent flag (`workSinceHandback`), checked before the routes split, and reset after each hand-back so one request earns one ping. Also: the channel-route hand-back no longer says "мой ответ выше в треде", which is a lie in somebody else's channel — it says the answer is in our thread, and the backlink says which.
- **A delivered answer no longer hijacks the requester's session.** The delivery posts `@requester <answer>` plus a link back to the answering thread into the requester's thread. That post mentions them, so their bot is woken by it — correct, they should see the answer — but it then re-parsed the message and took the backlink as a new reply-to address. From that point the requester's *next* answer, written for somebody else entirely, was delivered into the answerer's thread. A delivered answer is now marked as one (`↩ delivered-answer · мой тред: <link>`): the link stays visible as provenance, and the parser refuses to read it as an address. Replying back goes through `send_to_teammate`, which resolves the route itself.
- **An unused teammate mention no longer leaks into a later, unrelated turn.** When a turn did no work the hand-back was skipped correctly, but only half the state was cleared — the mention stayed pending and the next turn's first tool call armed it, splicing a teammate's name into an answer that had nothing to do with them (and waking them for it). Both fields are cleared together now.
- **A mention has to be earned by work, so two idle bots can't keep each other awake.** Every mention wakes the teammate's session, and their answer mentions us back — so a turn that produced nothing still triggered a full turn on the other side, which triggered one back. Observed twice within an hour on the fleet: `@Bebop Жду.` / `@April Ждём.` for a dozen rounds (both sides explicitly agreeing to stop, then continuing), and a rate-limited session whose entire output was *"You've hit your session limit · resets 4:50pm"* — delivered with a mention, waking the other bot to answer "нового нет", waking it again. Turns and tokens spent to say nothing. The teammate mention is now armed only once the turn actually calls a tool: reading one file is work, saying "ждём" is not. A turn that did no work wakes nobody and posts no hand-back ping either, which is what breaks the oscillation; the rate-limit case falls out of the same rule, since a session that never got to run a tool has nothing to announce. A turn that worked but ended without answer text still gets the separate ping, so a teammate is never left waiting on real work.
- **A bot restart no longer re-asks for a review of the same MR.** The review-ping guard lived in an in-memory `WeakMap`, on the reasoning that one duplicate ask was cheaper than another persisted field. It isn't: with the channel route the ask posts at channel level, which opens a *second* thread in the reviewer's world — and a thread is a session, so the reviewer gets a cold session that knows nothing about the review it already did, while the first thread holds all the context. The guard now lives on the session and is persisted (`reviewPing.pinged`), exactly like docs-ping's `settled` always was; `pullRequestUrl` was persisted all along, so half the mechanism remembered and half didn't. Missing or malformed persisted state degrades to "nothing asked yet".

### Changed
- **Cross-bot messages only ever land in a thread — the channel route is gone.** Handing off to a teammate who wasn't working in the current channel used to post at channel level in *their* channel. Every time it fired it made things worse: it opens a second thread for a conversation that already has one, the reply comes back over there, and the two halves drift apart — which is the problem shared channels were introduced to solve. Watched live on the fleet: krang pinged rocksteady correctly in the shared thread, rocksteady came and answered, and then krang pinged him *again* at channel level in his channel, duplicating the thread for no gain. So `resolveTeammateRoute` now has one answer, this thread, and returns null when the teammate holds no session here. `send_to_teammate` refuses with a reason that says what to do instead (nothing is sent — a silent failure would read as a delivered handoff); the docs and review pings skip rather than falling back to a channel; the hand-back is dropped. The backlink disappears with it: a handoff now always lands in the thread it would have linked to, where the link reads as the counterpart's thread and sends the reply into a dead end. **This depends on every bot being connected to every shared channel** — with `teammatesPresent` empty, cross-bot pings now go nowhere instead of going to a channel.
- **A teammate who asked us in this thread is called by name in the answer itself.** Their bot wakes only on a mention, so the hand-back used to arrive as its own post one quiescence window (90s) after the answer — the mechanism worked, but to everyone reading the channel the answer looked addressed to nobody and the ping looked like an afterthought. The mention is now spliced into the first line of the answer: armed when the teammate's message comes in, consumed by the first real assistant text that follows. Tool lines and `💭` thinking previews deliberately don't take it — a mention on `💻 Bash ×8` wakes the teammate to watch us work rather than to read an answer. The separate ping survives in exactly two cases: a teammate reachable only in their own channel (there is no answer of ours there to ride on), and a turn that produced no answer text at all, which would otherwise leave them waiting forever.
- **"Reply to me in this thread" is now a machine marker, `reply-to: <url>`.** The directive was natural language, so every emitter spelled it slightly differently and the parser had to recognise phrasings rather than a token. Code now writes `↩ reply-to: <permalink>` — one place decides the format (`buildReturnAddressMarker`) and one regex is its whole contract. The parser accepts both forms and will keep accepting the prose: that is the order the change has to happen in, since the fleet's prompts still teach agents to write it out, and a parser that learns the new form only after the old one is gone silently drops return addresses in between — a dropped address is an answer nobody ever receives.

### Added
- **`usageProbedAt` now means "when we last asked", not "when we last succeeded".** It was stamped only on a successful probe, so an account that starts failing every cycle — a logged-out OAuth account does exactly that — froze its timestamp at the last success and shipped it onward forever. A status board then cannot tell "no data for hours, probing itself is broken" from "asked two minutes ago and the account refused", which are opposite actions for whoever is on call. The per-model weekly window travels too: it can be the binding limit while both other windows look fine, and it is why the routing score can exceed both numbers a board displays.
- **Account usage in the health snapshot now carries the real limit windows, and can be refreshed on a schedule.** The pool only ever exposed one combined load score, which is all routing needs. A status board needs more: which window is nearly spent (`sessionPct` / `weekPct` — there is no daily one, Anthropic's are a rolling session block and a week), when it resets, and *when it was measured*, since "0% used" and "measured an hour ago" call for different reactions. Usage was probed only when a session started — right for routing, useless for a board on an idle bot — so `limits.usageRefreshMinutes` adds a slow periodic re-probe (off by default; the probe runs zero turns and costs $0, the cost is one CLI spawn per account).
- **The health snapshot reports how long the quietest mid-turn session has been silent (`stalestProcessingSeconds`).** This is what separates "working hard" from "wedged", and it needed no new bookkeeping: `lastActivityAt` is bumped on every post and every agent event, so a session that is genuinely working keeps it fresh, while one that reports `isProcessing` as this number climbs has stopped producing anything. `null` and `0` are deliberately different answers — nothing mid-turn versus something mid-turn that just spoke.
- **The bot writes a health snapshot for an outside watcher (`~/.claude-threads/health.json`).** Written every monitor tick with the numbers only the bot knows: session cap, sessions live now, how many are mid-turn, and per Claude account the cooldown deadline and last `/usage` load score. Deliberately a file rather than an endpoint, and deliberately excludes host facts: the failure it exists for was a bot whose process was alive and getting CPU but had stopped answering — load average 43.7, 464 MB free of 15 GB, one runaway agent `Grep` at 5.49 GB RSS. Anything running inside that process was equally starved and could not have reported it, so the file's *staleness* is the signal, and it is the one thing a wedged process cannot fake. Written temp-and-rename so a poller never reads a torn file, and a failed write is swallowed — silence already produces the right outcome. The heartbeat runs before the rest of the monitor cycle, so a cycle that throws later has still left a fresh timestamp.
- **The bot asks for the review, not the agent (`reviewPing`).** Nothing in code ever requested a code review — it was a line in the agent's prompt ("write to @rocksteady when you need a review"), and an agent deep in its own task doesn't act on a suggestion. Observed: a docs bot opened an MR, noticed on its own that GitLab required an approver sign-off, reported that fact, and asked nobody. Now, once a session that opened a merge request goes quiet, the reviewer is called deterministically — routed by the same rule `send_to_teammate` and the docs ping use: a reviewer working in this channel is asked in this thread, next to the code; otherwise in their own channel with a link back. Asked once per MR, never of itself (guarded by name and by channel), and skipped while the agent is still working. No judge: the pain was reviews never being requested, not being requested too often.

### Changed
- **The first @mention picks your bot for the rest of the thread.** In a shared multi-bot channel (`respondOnlyWhenMentioned`), every follow-up needed its own @mention, which is what makes a shared channel tiring to use. Now the person who opened a session owns the dialogue in that thread: their plain replies go through without a mention, in both the active and the idle-paused path. A session another bot opened via `send_to_teammate` has `startedBy` set to that bot, so it stays mention-only — two bots in one thread never both answer the same message. Messages from anyone else, and messages that open with `@someone-else`, are still captured as thread context only.
- **Idling out is silent.** The "Session idle — will timeout in ~N minutes" warning and the "Session timed out after N minutes / react 🔄 to resume" notice both fired on every thread left open and said nothing the thread didn't already show. Neither is posted now, and resuming a silently-paused session no longer posts a banner either. Nothing else changes: the session is still persisted and paused, a plain reply still resumes it, 🔄 on the session header still resumes it, and the channel sticky still lists it as ⏸️ resumable (keyed off `isPaused` instead of the notice's post id).
- **A run of `Bash` commands renders as one self-rewriting line.** Eight commands in a row produced eight blocks — each with a blank line and a `↳ ✓` result line under it — and because the display budget is 50 characters while `cd ~/workspaces/workdir/<project> &&` eats ~40 of them, all eight rendered as the same truncated prefix. The `cd` scaffolding is now stripped so the command itself is visible, and consecutive calls to the same tool collapse into a single line that updates in place: `💻 Bash ×8 glab ci status ✓ (41s)`. The outcome is stamped onto that line instead of adding another one. Any other content (text, a different tool) ends the run, so a single call looks exactly as it did before. Tools opt in via `ToolFormatResult.group`, and the cheap inspection tools — `Bash`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` — share one key: keying the line per tool name left most of the wall in place, because those four interleave (read a file, run a command, read another). `Edit`/`Write` stay out of it; their diffs are the point.

### Added
- **Multi-account pool balances new sessions by real subscription usage.** When a Claude account pool is configured, new sessions used to be spread by round-robin / sticky-by-thread, which ignores how much of each account's rate limit has actually been consumed — a nearly-capped account was as likely to be picked as a fresh one. The pool now routes each new session to the account with the most headroom: at session start the bot probes every account's live limits with `claude -p "/usage" --output-format json` (runs zero turns, costs $0) under that account's `HOME`, parses the reported percentages, and selects the lowest `max(session%, week%)` non-cooling account. Probing is on-demand and synchronous — an idle bot probes nothing — with a short hot-path deadline, in-flight coalescing, and a brief result cache so a burst of concurrent starts triggers a single set of probes rather than one per start. In-flight sessions add a small provisional load penalty so a burst spreads across accounts instead of piling onto the single lowest one, and a rotating cursor breaks exact ties. A failed/timed-out/unparseable probe marks that account "usage unknown" so it sorts last (routing around a logged-out OAuth account, whose auth error never triggers rate-limit cooldown); if every account is unknown, selection degrades gracefully to round-robin. Resume is unaffected — it still re-binds to the persisted `claudeAccountId` so a session resumes under the `HOME` its history lives in. Targets OAuth (subscription) accounts; API-key accounts have no `/usage` limits and sort as unknown. The channel sticky message now shows the pool's `min–max % used` range. (#419)

## [1.17.3] - 2026-07-01

### Dependencies
- **Production:** `@hono/node-server` 2.0.5 → 2.0.6, `hono` 4.12.26 → 4.12.27, `semver` 7.8.4 → 7.8.5. (#417)
- **Dev:** `@types/node` 25 → 26, `typescript-eslint` 8.61.1 → 8.62.1. (#416)

### Changed
- **Held `js-yaml` on 4.x and added a dependabot ignore for `js-yaml >=5.0.0`.** Dependabot grouped a `js-yaml` 4.x → 5.x major into the production bump, but 5.x is ESM-only and dropped the CommonJS `default` export, breaking our `import yaml from 'js-yaml'` call sites with `Missing 'default' export`. The bump now stays on 4.x until the code migrates to named ESM imports. (#417)
- **CI:** `actions/checkout` 6 → 7. (#413)

### Security
- **`@hono/node-server` 2.0.4 → 2.0.5** to resolve GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9: on Windows, prefix-mounted Serve Static middleware could be bypassed. Only affects Windows deployments using Serve Static. (#408)

### Dependencies
- **Production:** `hono` 4.12.25 → 4.12.26, `semver` 7.8.1 → 7.8.4. (#408)
- **Dev:** `@types/node` 25.9.1 → 25.9.3, `@types/react` 19.2.16 → 19.2.17, `eslint` 10.4.1 → 10.5.0, `prettier` 3.8.3 → 3.8.4, `typescript-eslint` 8.60.1 → 8.61.1. (#409)

## [1.17.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Quiet mode (`!mentions on`) now survives an idle pause.** A session with "respond only when mentioned" enabled would still resume on the first non-mention reply once it had been paused for inactivity, defeating the whole point of quiet mode. The active-session path honored the gate but the paused-session resume path did not check the persisted `respondOnlyWhenMentioned` flag, so any plain message woke the session up. The resume path now applies the same gate: while quiet mode is on, a reply that doesn't @mention the bot no longer resumes a paused session. Commands (including `!stop`) still bypass the gate as before. (#410)

### Security
- **`hono` 4.12.23 → 4.12.25** to resolve CVE-2026-54290 (HIGH): the CORS middleware reflected any `Origin` with credentials when `origin` defaulted to `*`.
- **Pinned transitive `ws` ≥ 8.21.0 and `shell-quote` ≥ 1.8.4** (both pulled in via `ink`) to clear GHSA-96hv-2xvq-fx4p (HIGH, `ws` memory-exhaustion DoS) and GHSA-w7jw-789q-3m8p (CRITICAL, `shell-quote` newline escaping). Added to the existing `overrides`/`resolutions` blocks; runtime behavior is unchanged.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **`!mentions` quiet mode: respond only when @mentioned.** New per-session toggle for holding side conversations inside a bot thread without the bot replying to every message. `!mentions on` makes the bot ignore thread replies that don't explicitly @mention it; `!mentions off` (or a bare `!mentions` to flip the current value) turns it back off. Commands and pending worktree-branch-name prompts always bypass the gate, so `!mentions off` (and answering a worktree prompt) works even while quiet mode is on. When quiet mode is on, the session header shows a row noting it, so a returning user can see why the bot is staying quiet. The setting is owned by the session owner or a globally allowed user and persists across a bot restart. A global `respondOnlyWhenMentioned: true` in `config.yaml` (also offered in the onboarding wizard) seeds quiet mode on every new thread, so users who mostly want quiet threads don't have to run `!mentions on` each time; each session still keeps its own value and can override per-thread. The default everywhere is unchanged (the bot treats every approved-user reply as input), so existing threads and configs are unaffected. (#402)

### Dependencies
- **Production:** `js-yaml` 4.1.1 → 4.2.0, `react` 19.2.6 → 19.2.7. (#404)
- **Dev:** `typescript-eslint` 8.60.0 → 8.60.1. (#403)

## [1.16.3] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **Fixed the flaky Mattermost integration suite (two independent root causes).** These tests failed intermittently in CI, including on `main`, so this was a pre-existing infra flake rather than a regression. (1) *Channel contention:* every pooled test bot posted into one shared channel, each maintaining its own sticky message; run together the suites flooded that channel and tripped the Mattermost threads write race (`threads_pkey` 500s), surfacing as flaky task-list / context-prompt failures. Each suite now provisions a fresh channel via `initIsolatedTestContext`, routes its bot there, and removes it in `afterAll`, which eliminated the 500 storms. (2) *Leaked bot state across suites:* the bot/session/sticky layer keeps module-level global state (`stickyPostIds`, the session registry, the pool cursor) and live WebSockets, and Bun runs all suite files in one process. A bot whose socket wasn't fully torn down kept processing events into the next suite (posting "Bot Offline" stickies, resuming stale sessions), which broke the sticky suite. CI now runs each suite file in its own process, so process exit clears all shared state by construction. A follow-up also corrected the `should show status indicators` assertion, which required keep-alive indicators that a bypass-mode session-less bot never shows (it only passed before via the leaked state that process isolation removed). Test/CI-only; no runtime behavior changed. (#396, #398, #399)

### Dependencies
- **Production:** `@hono/node-server` 2.0.3 → 2.0.4, `hono` 4.12.21 → 4.12.23, `semver` 7.8.0 → 7.8.1, `ws` 8.20.1 → 8.21.0. `commander` 14 → 15 was deliberately held back: v15 requires Node ≥ 22.12 (the runtime floor is Node 20) and changes the default behavior of paired `--no-*` options the CLI relies on. (#401)
- **Dev:** `eslint` 10.4.0 → 10.4.1, `lint-staged`, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.4 → 8.60.0. Lockfile-only. (#400)

## [1.16.2] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **Sturdier retry budget for the Mattermost post-save race.** Under load Mattermost can return a burst of 500s on `POST /posts` (the threads write race: duplicate key on `threads_pkey` / `app.post.save.app_error`) when several posts stream to the same thread. The retry budget was 3 attempts with plain exponential backoff; a heavy burst exhausted it and dropped a post, which surfaced as flaky task-list / sticky / context-prompt behavior. The budget is now 6 attempts with a capped (2s), equal-jittered backoff. The cap keeps the total wait bounded so a long retry chain can't itself stall things, and the jitter decorrelates concurrent posts that would otherwise re-collide on the same row lock every round. (#394)
- **Two remaining memory leaks after #351.** First, `MessageManager.dispose()` cleared the post tracker but never called `this.events.removeAllListeners()` on the per-session emitter. Each session attaches a handful of listeners (`question:complete`, `task:update`, `approval:complete`, and the rest), and their closures kept session state reachable after the session ended, so the heap grew with every session. `dispose()` now removes the listeners before resetting. Second, React 19 enables user timing when both `console.timeStamp` and `performance.measure` exist (the case on Node.js 25+), so every component re-render calls `performance.measure()` with a structured-clone'd prop-diff detail that Node buffers indefinitely (~50-205 KB per entry, ~2 GB after a long uptime). Nothing in the bot reads those entries, so a guarded `setInterval` clears them every 60 seconds with `.unref()` so it never blocks a clean exit. (#394)

## [1.16.1] - 2026-05-22

### Security
- **Fail-closed authorization on the user-driven paths that invoke Claude.** A confirmed bypass let an unauthorized Slack user (not in `allowedUsers`, non-empty allowlist) reach Claude: the bot posted both the "not authorized" warning and a real answer in the same thread. Rather than chase the one leaking caller, authorization is now deny-by-default at the functions that spawn or message Claude on a user's behalf: `startSession`, `sendFollowUp`, and `resumePausedSession`, plus the resume-from-reaction path. A single helper, `isAuthorizedForSession`, encodes every tier (global allowlist, empty-allowlist allow-all, per-session owner and invited users) and refuses a missing, empty, or `unknown` username. Every user-facing path now routes through that one helper instead of duplicating the check. The biggest gap was message-driven resume, which ran purely from persisted state with no identity check; it now takes a `username` and verifies it against the persisted session allowlist before resuming. The two system-triggered resume paths (bulk restore after a bot restart) stay ungated by design, since they carry no user identity. Legitimate username-less follow-ups (passthrough slash commands like `/context`, already authorized upstream) pass an explicit `system` flag so they are not caught. The mid-session approval flow is untouched: it still adds approved users to the session allowlist, so the check passes once approval is granted. (#388)
- **hono 4.12.18 → 4.12.21** picks up four upstream security fixes: GHSA-2gcr-mfcq-wcc3 (`app.mount()` stripped the mount prefix from the raw, undecoded pathname, so percent-encoded paths could be cut at the wrong offset and reach a sub-app with the wrong path), GHSA-xrhx-7g5j-rcj5 (`hono/ip-restriction` compared IPs by string equality, so non-canonical IPv6 forms such as compressed or hex IPv4-mapped addresses slipped past static deny rules), GHSA-3hrh-pfw6-9m5x (the cookie helper didn't sanitize `sameSite`/`priority`, allowing Set-Cookie injection via `;`, `\r`, `\n`), and GHSA-f577-qrjj-4474 (`hono/jwt` accepted any two-part Authorization header regardless of scheme, not just `Bearer`). claude-threads reaches hono through `@hono/node-server` on the inbound webhook surface, so the mount-prefix and Set-Cookie fixes are the relevant ones. (#386)

### Changed
- **Production deps** bumped: `@hono/node-server` 2.0.2 → 2.0.3 (preserves headers mutated after raw Response construction), `express-rate-limit` 8.5.1 → 8.5.2 (simplified IPv6 key generation). Lockfile-only. (#386)
- **Dev deps** bumped: `@types/bun` 1.3.13 → 1.3.14, `@types/node` 25.7.0 → 25.9.1, `@types/react` 19.2.14 → 19.2.15, `eslint` 10.3.0 → 10.4.0 (adds `includeIgnoreFile()` and a `for-direction` sequence-expression check, both additive), `lint-staged` 17.0.4 → 17.0.5, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.3 → 8.59.4 (fixes a `no-floating-promises` stack overflow on recursive types). Lockfile-only. (#385)

### Fixed
- **Multiple pasted screenshots no longer silently vanish.** When you paste several clipboard images into one chat message, the platforms hand them all the same filename (`image.png`). The save path wrote each one with the `wx` (`O_EXCL`) flag, so the second and later files hit `EEXIST`, got caught, and were reported as a download failure, so they never reached Claude. Saves now dedupe filenames within a single message, inserting a numeric suffix before the extension (`image.png`, `image_1.png`, `image_2.png`); files without an extension get `report`, `report_1`, and so on. The unique name is resolved before the write, so the `wx` flag still does its job against symlink races. (#387)
- **Inbound attachments are no longer capped at 100 MB.** A hard 100 MB ceiling on incoming files meant anything larger was skipped with a "too large" warning, which surprised people sharing big assets. The cap is gone; an attachment of any reported size is downloaded and written to disk. One tradeoff worth knowing: `downloadFile` still buffers the whole file in memory via `arrayBuffer()`, so a very large attachment is held in RAM while it's written. Streaming that download is a separate change. (#387)

## [1.16.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Per-platform channel-verbosity controls.** New `sessionHeader` and `stickyMessage` settings, both `full` (default) / `minimal` (one-line status bar) / `hidden` (no post). Reachable three ways: setup wizard ("How verbose should the bot be in this channel?"), CLI flags (`--session-header`, `--sticky-message`, applied to every platform), or per-platform YAML for split values. `hidden` for the header means Claude's reply is the first message in the thread; `hidden` for the sticky stops the `channel_post` bump entirely. Update notices still ride along in `minimal`. Session-header mode persists per session — resume preserves the user's choice. Old `sessions.json` defaults to `full`. The pre-existing top-level `stickyMessage: { description, footer }` block is unchanged. (#384, closes #383)

### Security
- **`ws` 8.20.0 → 8.20.1** picks up a fix for an uninitialized memory disclosure in `websocket.close()`. Triggered when a `TypedArray` (e.g. `Float32Array`) is passed as the `reason` argument instead of a string or `Buffer` — uninitialized memory was leaked to the remote peer. claude-threads doesn't pass typed arrays to `close()` anywhere we control, but the Mattermost client and inbound webhook surface use `ws` as a transitive dependency. (#382)

### Changed
- **Production deps** bumped: `@hono/node-server` 2.0.1 → 2.0.2 (serve-static fixes), `react` 19.2.5 → 19.2.6 (RSC type hardening), `semver` 7.7.4 → 7.8.0 (new `truncate` function), `ink-scroll-view` 0.3.6 → 0.3.7. Lockfile-only. (#382)
- **Dev deps** bumped: `@types/node` 25.6.0 → 25.7.0, `lint-staged` 16.4.0 → 17.0.4, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.2 → 8.59.3. lint-staged 17 drops Node 20 support, but it's a dev dep — the bot's runtime floor is unchanged. Lockfile-only. (#381)

## [1.15.2] - 2026-05-06

### Security
- **hono 4.12.15 → 4.12.17** picks up two upstream security fixes — GHSA-69xw-7hcm-h432 (unvalidated JSX tag names in `hono/jsx` could allow HTML injection) and GHSA-9vqf-7f2p-gf9v (`bodyLimit()` could be bypassed for chunked / unknown-length requests). claude-threads doesn't render JSX from untrusted input today, but the bodyLimit fix is load-bearing for the inbound webhook surface. (#377)

### Changed
- **Production deps** bumped: `@hono/node-server` 2.0.0 → 2.0.1 (forwards Hono response headers during WebSocket upgrade), `express-rate-limit` 8.4.1 → 8.5.0 (async store init), `zod` 4.3.6 → 4.4.3 (correctness fixes for `preprocess`, `catch`, and discriminated unions on absent object keys). Lockfile-only. (#377)
- **Dev deps** bumped: `eslint` 10.2.1 → 10.3.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.1 → 8.59.2. Lockfile-only. (#376)

## [1.15.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Numeric tool args no longer fail at the MCP boundary when the runtime sends them as strings.** Surfaced live during dogfooding of v1.15.0: calling `search_messages` with `max_results: 5` returned `Invalid input: expected number, received string` from the MCP framework, because the Claude MCP runtime sometimes serializes integer tool arguments as JSON strings before they reach the server, and the receiving `z.number().int()` schema rejected them at parse time. Switched the four affected fields to `z.coerce.number().int()` — `read_post.max_messages`, `list_thread.max_messages`, `read_channel_history.max_messages`, `search_messages.max_results` — so either form parses. Downstream `clamp*` helpers already defend against non-finite / non-positive values, so coercion can't widen the contract beyond the documented caps; non-integer strings like `"1.5"` still fail because `.int()` runs after coercion. Schemas exported so a contract test can verify the coercion without spinning up the full MCP transport. (#375)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Claude can DM channel members directly via the new `send_dm` MCP tool.** When the user asks for a private ping ("DM me when this finishes," "send the report to alice as a DM"), Claude can now call `send_dm(recipient, message)` instead of asking the user to forward the result themselves. The recipient is a Mattermost username (`@anne` or `anne`) or a Slack user id (`U…`/`<@U…>`) — the asymmetry exists because Slack bot tokens can't reverse-look usernames cheaply, and paginating `users.list` per call is wasteful. Six gates run in order: shape (recipient and message non-empty, message under 4000-char cap), recipient resolution (platform API turns the input into a user id + canonical username), self-DM guard, channel membership (recipient must be a current member of the bot channel, fetched once and cached for 60s), rate limit (3 DMs per recipient per session, optimistic counter increment with rollback on deny / timeout / send-error), and a per-recipient interactive permission prompt the first time the session DMs each user. ✅ promotes that recipient — and only that recipient — to no-prompt for the rest of the session; the rate limit still applies. An in-flight set blocks parallel `send_dm` calls to the same recipient from posting duplicate prompts when Claude fans out tool_use blocks in a single turn. Every DM is prefixed with an attribution line — `_(automated message via claude-threads, on behalf of @anne from #channel)_` — so recipients can trace it back to the session that sent it; the channel name is fetched lazily via the platform's channel-info endpoint, the session-owner username is plumbed in from `session.startedBy` through a new `SESSION_OWNER_USERNAME` env var that threads `lifecycle.ts` → `restart-options.ts` → `ClaudeCliOptions` → `buildPermissionArgs` → MCP child (covers all five `new ClaudeCli` sites). New optional `McpPlatformApi` methods `getChannelMembers`, `resolveRecipient`, `sendDirectMessage`; `getChannelInfo` gained a `name?` field. RED-GREEN tests on every load-bearing guard — self-DM check, membership, rate limit, attribution prefix, allow-all-is-per-recipient, counter rollback on deny / timeout, in-flight-prompt deduplication. (#374)

## [1.14.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **`!update` no longer leaves an interactive bot dead.** The auto-restart path silently broke for users running in a terminal. PR #333 (April) skipped the bash daemon when stdout was a TTY, because the daemon's bash background-job pattern strips the TTY and forces headless mode, but the bot's `!update` flow assumed the daemon was always there to catch exit code 42 and re-exec. Without the daemon, `process.exit(42)` just exited. Install succeeded, sessions persisted, then nothing came back. The fix introduces a `decideRespawn()` step before the exit. When a known supervisor is present (`CLAUDE_THREADS_BIN` from the bash daemon, `pm_id` + `PM2_HOME` from pm2, `INVOCATION_ID` from systemd, `CLAUDE_THREADS_INTERACTIVE` from a TTY-managing wrapper) the bot still exits 42 and lets the supervisor handle the restart so its restart-counters and rate-limits keep working. Otherwise, when there is a TTY, the bot self-respawns. It synchronously resolves `claude-threads` on PATH (with a fallback to `~/.bun/bin` because cron / systemd / launchd `PATH=` is often missing it), then `spawn(binPath, argv, { detached: true, stdio: 'inherit', shell: process.platform === 'win32' })` followed by `unref()` and `exit(0)`. The Node docs cover this combination explicitly: when stdio is inherited, the detached child stays attached to the parent's controlling terminal, so the new process inherits the TUI cleanly. Several footguns are handled. `spawn()` does not throw on ENOENT, it returns a child with `pid === undefined` and fires the `error` event asynchronously, so we check `pid` synchronously instead of trusting a try/catch that never triggers. Bun passes `env: { X: undefined }` as the literal string `"undefined"` (Node correctly omits it), so the auto-restart hand-off vars are removed via `delete` rather than overwrite. Windows `.cmd` shims need `shell: true` since Node 20.12.2 (CVE-2024-27980). Ink's raw mode is reset before the spawn so the new child starts with a clean stdin. If self-respawn cannot launch (no `claude-threads` on PATH at all), the bot broadcasts a clear "could not auto-restart, please run `claude-threads`" message before exiting, so the user is not left wondering what happened. Four prior PRs (#287, #300, #317, #333) chased this in the daemon path. This one fixes the bot side instead. (#372)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- **`read_post` allows cross-channel reads on public Mattermost channels.** The cross-channel guard kept rejecting permalinks that pointed outside the bot's session channel — appropriate for private/DM/group channels (real privacy concern: a thread participant without access to the source channel sees content they shouldn't), but overzealous for public channels where anyone with an account can already navigate to the post. `McpPost` now carries a `channelType?: 'public' | 'private'` field, populated for Mattermost via `/channels/{id}` (type `O` = public; `P`/`D`/`G` = private) with a per-process cache so chatty threads don't trigger N redundant lookups. The resolver skips the wrong-channel check when `channelType === 'public'`; missing `channelType` is treated as private (fail-safe). Slack is unchanged: its MCP-side `readPost` is hard-scoped to the bot's configured channel via `conversations.history`, so cross-channel reads aren't possible there regardless of channel visibility. (#369)

## [1.13.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **`read_post` works on Mattermost subpath installs.** `parseMattermostPermalink` matched only on origin and ignored the configured baseUrl path, so on a Mattermost install at `/chat` (e.g. `digilab.overheid.nl/chat`) every permalink had a leading `/chat` segment that pushed the path to four segments and got rejected with "not a Mattermost permalink for ..." even though the link was on the bot's own instance. The parser now strips the configured subpath as a path-segment prefix before validating the `{team}/pl/{id}` or `_redirect/pl/{id}` shape; segment-level comparison so `/chat` doesn't accidentally match `/chatter`. Regression from #366. (#368)

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Claude can follow chat permalinks via the new `read_post` MCP tool.** When the user shares a Mattermost or Slack permalink in the thread, Claude can call `read_post(url, include_thread?, max_messages?)` to resolve it to the post body (and optional thread context) instead of asking the user to copy-paste. Auto-approved like `send_file`: the URL host check (Mattermost) or workspace `*.slack.com` + channel-id match (Slack) inside the handler are the real gate, since the bot's token is already scoped to what it can see. Defaults: 20 thread messages per call (hard cap 50), 2000-char body truncation per message, returned content marked as untrusted user input in the tool description (prompt-injection note). (#366)
- **Session collaborators surface as `Co-Authored-By:` trailers on commits Claude makes.** When the session owner runs `!invite @user`, that user's name + email is added to the system-prompt attribution block; the owner is the implicit author and is excluded, and the bot account plus AI assistants are excluded explicitly. Mid-session updates work without restart: `!invite` and `!kick` post a "Collaborators updated" notice in the thread, and Claude reads the current list from there on its next turn. Solo sessions still get a one-line standby instruction so a later `!invite` is honored without a respawn. All four Claude (re)spawn sites — `startSession`, `resumeSession`, `!cd`, worktree create/join — now compose the system prompt through one helper so the attribution rule cannot silently drop on respawn. Collaborators without a resolvable email are skipped silently rather than producing a malformed trailer. (#367)

### Changed
- **MCP package renamed `claude-threads-permissions` → `claude-threads-mcp`** to match the broader MCP-server scope (permission prompts, file uploads, post reads — no longer permission-only). Tool names exposed to Claude follow: `mcp__claude-threads-permissions__send_file` → `mcp__claude-threads-mcp__send_file`, etc. **Breaking for in-flight sessions across upgrade**: a Claude run that started under the old name will see the new tool names after restart, so any auto-approve rules tied to the old prefix need updating. The bot itself rewires automatically. (#366)
- **`src/mcp/permission-server.ts` renamed to `src/mcp/mcp-server.ts`.** Same content, accurate name. The npm `bin` entry `claude-threads-mcp` already pointed at the dist artifact, so no change for downstream installs apart from the bundled-file path inside the dist tarball. (#366)

### Internals
- **`PermissionApi` interface renamed to `McpPlatformApi`.** The interface now covers permission prompts, file uploads, and post reads, so the old name no longer fits. Includes file renames (`src/platform/permission-api*.ts` → `src/platform/mcp-platform-api*.ts`) and the matching impl files under `src/platform/{mattermost,slack}/`. (#366)
- **Shared permalink utilities at `src/platform/permalink-shared.ts`.** Caps (`DEFAULT_THREAD_LIMIT`, `MAX_THREAD_LIMIT`, `MAX_MESSAGE_BODY_CHARS`) and helpers (`clampThreadLimit`, `truncateBody`, `quoteBlock`) used by both Mattermost and Slack permalink modules — prevents drift on rendering rules. (#366)
- **Shared `fetch` test harness at `src/platform/test-helpers/fetch-harness.ts`.** Consolidates the recorder + responder pattern that lived in three platform-API test files. (#366)
- **`buildAppendSystemPrompt` helper in `src/commands/system-prompt-generator.ts`.** Single composition point for the four Claude (re)spawn sites; covers solo-standby and full-collaborator forms with shared exclusion guidance for owner / bot / AI. (#367)
- **`GitHubEmailsStore` (`src/persistence/github-emails-store.ts`).** Persists collaborator email lookups so the attribution block can be rebuilt after a restart without re-querying the platform. (#367)

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Claude can send files inline via the new `send_file` MCP tool.** Closes #360. When Claude produces an artifact during a session — Playwright screenshot, generated TTS MP3, plot, document — it can now post the file directly into the chat thread by calling `send_file(path, caption?)` instead of asking the user to fetch it from a URL. The tool runs inside the per-session `claude-threads-permissions` MCP child (no second MCP server needed), validates the path against the session working directory and per-session upload directory, then drives the Mattermost two-step `/api/v4/files` + `/api/v4/posts file_ids` flow or Slack's three-step v2 flow (`files.getUploadURLExternal` + presigned PUT + `files.completeUploadExternal`). Returns `{ ok: true, postId }` on success or `{ ok: false, reason }` on failure so Claude can retry or apologize to the user. Auto-approved by the permission gate (path validator is the real gate; making the user 👍 every screenshot would defeat the feature). Available in all three permission modes (`default`, `auto`, `bypass`) — bypass-mode now spawns the MCP server too so the tool stays available in the build-anything-on-demand setups that motivated the issue. Optional `outboundFiles: { enabled?, maxBytes? }` block on each platform config — defaults to enabled with a 100 MB cap. Reuses the per-thread upload directory and `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` ceiling already established by inbound attachments (PR #359). The system prompt now leads with "You are RIGHT NOW running inside a chat thread" and explicitly tells the model not to claim the tool is unavailable, after a manual test caught the model improvising an apology even though the tool was wired up. (#361)

### Security
- **Path validator hardens `send_file` against traversal and tricks.** New `src/mcp/path-validator.ts`. Rejects: non-absolute paths, anything that resolves (via `realpath`) outside the session working directory or per-session upload directory (path-prefix containment, so `/srv/sessions-evil` does not match `/srv/sessions`), non-regular files (FIFOs, sockets, devices, directories), SUID/SGID files, oversize files, zero-byte files (which Slack's upload endpoint rejects anyway), and dangerously wide allowed roots like `/`, `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/tmp` (so a misconfigured `SESSION_WORKING_DIR` fails loudly instead of widening the trust boundary). The uploader receives the realpath-resolved path so it can't be re-pointed by a symlink between validation and read. Every reject branch has a unit test verified RED-GREEN against the live function. Follow-ups for TOCTOU between validate and read, per-session rate-limiting, and caption-length truncation tracked in #362-#365. (#361)

### Internals
- **`buildRestartCliOptions` helper.** Five places in the codebase construct a `ClaudeCli` (start, resume, `!cd`, `!permissions interactive`, `!worktree create`/`switch`). Each must thread `uploadDir` and `outboundFiles` through, or `send_file` silently breaks for that path. Two of the five (worktree paths) were skipped in the original PR and only caught by manual testing. Extracted to `src/claude/restart-options.ts` so all sites share one source of truth. (#361)
- **Env-var contract test pins names across the bot↔MCP-child boundary.** `OUTBOUND_ENV` constants in `src/mcp/outbound-env.ts` are referenced by both `buildPermissionArgs` (emit side) and `permission-server.ts` (consume side); a contract test asserts the names match and no bare string literal is used on either side. Caught a class of silent rename-drift bugs that would otherwise type-check and unit-test green while breaking the feature at runtime. (#361)
- **Portable chmod helper for tests.** Bun 1.3.x masks the SUID/SGID/sticky bits in `fs.chmod` and `chmodSync` (verified against 1.3.3); the SUID-rejection branch of the path validator was untestable without a workaround. New `src/test-utils/chmod-portable.ts` `setMode()` tries the runtime's chmod, verifies via `stat`, and falls back to `/bin/chmod` if the high bits didn't land. Works on Node (fast path) and Bun (shell fallback). (#361)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Chat attachments delivered to Claude as file paths instead of inlined base64.** When a user attaches an image, PDF, text file, or anything else to a chat message, the bot now writes the bytes to a per-thread directory under `os.tmpdir()/claude-threads-uploads/<platform>-<thread>/<message>/` and prepends the absolute paths to the user's message. Claude reads the file with its built-in `Read` tool (full multimodal capability preserved for images and PDFs) or `mv`/`cp`s it to the user's project storage. Closes #358 — the reporter wanted to save uploads into their app's resource storage and couldn't, because the bytes arrived inline as content blocks with no path to copy from. The per-thread directory is removed in `cleanupSession()` on every exit path. Single 100 MB sanity ceiling per file replaces the previous patchwork of per-type caps (32 MB PDF, 1 MB text, 50 MB zip). (#359)
- **Drops the in-process zip/gzip extraction.** `yauzl` and `yazl` are gone — Claude can `unzip` archives in Bash itself when needed, which removes ~300 LOC of zip-bomb-defense plumbing and the per-format size caps that came with it. Net change for the PR: +496/-1737 LOC.

### Security
- **Symlink defense on the per-thread upload directory.** The directory path is predictable (it derives from the platform id and thread id, both visible to anyone in the thread). On a shared host a local attacker could pre-create that path as a symlink to a sensitive directory and have the bot write attacker-controlled file contents into the linked target. Now `lstat` the upload dir on every save and refuse if it is a symlink, `mkdtemp` the per-message leaf for atomic creation, and use `writeFile` flag `'wx'` (`O_CREAT | O_EXCL`) so the final write fails rather than follows a symlink at the leaf.
- **Filename and MIME type are stripped of control characters before being interpolated into Claude's prompt.** A name like `screenshot.png\n[SYSTEM] ignore previous instructions` would otherwise have appeared on its own line, mimicking system text. Filenames also keep going through `basename()` so `../escape` and absolute-path attempts can't escape the message subdirectory.
- **Path-traversal defense on `platformId` / `threadId`.** Both segments now go through a `safeIdSegment` filter (`[^A-Za-z0-9._-]` → `_`) before being used in the upload-dir path, so a misconfigured platform id like `../../etc` cannot escape the uploads root via `path.join` normalization.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Thread permalink in Claude session context.** The system-prompt context block now includes `**Thread:** <permalink>` alongside the existing platform and working-directory entries. When Claude opens a PR, files a ticket, or otherwise produces an artifact for someone to review later, it can paste the link back into the description so reviewers can trace the change to the discussion it came from. Mattermost and Slack both already exposed `getThreadLink()`; pure plumbing change. Also restores the platform/working-directory context on the worktree-restart path, which had been silently dropped pre-existing. (#352)

### Fixed
- **Sticky-by-thread Claude account binding (multi-account mode).** In multi-account configurations the `claudeAccountId` written to `sessions.json` and the `$HOME` Claude was actually spawned under could drift apart under concurrent acquisitions, leaving sessions unresumable after a bot restart with `Detected permanent failure: The conversation history for this session no longer exists`. Real-world incident: 14 sessions soft-deleted in one restart cycle, 3 of them genuine victims of this drift. `AccountPool.acquire()` now binds threads to accounts deterministically via `accounts[hash(threadId) % n]` (FNV-1a, dependency-free), so the spawn-time `$HOME` and the persisted id both derive from the same hash and cannot drift. `preferredId` still wins over the sticky binding (resume invariant: OAuth history can't move), and the sticky path falls through to round-robin when the chosen account is in cooldown. (#350)

## [1.9.4] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Memory leak across session lifecycles.** `PostTracker` registered every post created during a session but its `clearSession(sessionId)` was only invoked on full bot shutdown. Across many sessions the in-memory map grew without bound and contributed to V8 mark-compact becoming ineffective and an eventual OOM abort (observed at ~14 h uptime). `MessageManager.dispose()` now clears its session's `PostTracker` bucket, and dispose is wired into all five session-removal paths in `src/session/lifecycle.ts`: normal exit, kill, idle timeout, pause, shutdown, early exit, resume-fail, plus the start-failure and resume-failure error branches that bypass the shared cleanup helpers. (#356, fixes #351)

## [1.9.3] - 2026-04-24

### Internals

- **Extracted `ReactionRouter` from `SessionManager`** into `src/session/reaction-router.ts`. The reaction dispatch logic (allowlist gate, audit log, resume-from-reaction, session-level reactions, MessageManager fallthrough) previously inlined as three private methods on `SessionManager` now lives in its own module behind an explicit `ReactionRouterDeps` interface. Pure extraction — no behavior change, no persisted-schema change. `manager.ts` dropped from 1767 to 1633 LOC. (#348)
- **Lifecycle FSM** (`src/session/lifecycle-fsm.ts`). `transitionTo()` now validates each `from → to` change against an allowed-transition table. Warn-only by default — illegal transitions log at `warn` with a structured `fsm.illegal_transition` payload and the state assignment proceeds. Set `CLAUDE_THREADS_FSM_STRICT=1` to throw instead. The transition table is derived from observed transitions in the codebase, not an idealised graph; wiring it up surfaced five legitimate transitions (`starting→paused`, `starting→interrupted`, `starting→restarting`, `paused→restarting`, `interrupted→paused`) that the original comment block didn't mention. (#349)
- **Removed `CLAUDE_THREADS_SERIALIZE_V2` rollback flag** from PR 3. `persistSession` now unconditionally goes through `MessageManager.serialize()`. One release of bake time with the parity test as guard; snapshot tests remain. (#349)
- **Removed `CLAUDE_THREADS_MCP_CONFIG_INLINE` rollback flag** from PR 2. Production always writes the MCP config to an owner-only tempfile (mode 0600); the `inline` opt on `materializeMcpConfig` stays as a test-only shortcut. (#349)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Unreadable `[object ErrorEvent]` in WebSocket error logs.** Recent Node / undici deliver a browser-style `ErrorEvent` (not a plain `Error`) to `ws.onerror`, and `` `${event}` `` stringifies that wrapper to `[object ErrorEvent]` — the original failure cause was being dropped. New `formatWebSocketError(err)` helper in `src/platform/utils.ts` pulls the first usable signal (`.message` → `.error.message` → `.type (code: .code)` → `String(err)`), wired into all five WebSocket error sites across Slack + Mattermost main clients, both MCP permission-server clients, and the UI re-emit. The Slack client's rejection and re-emitted `Error` now carry the underlying message too, instead of the opaque `"Socket Mode WebSocket error"`. (#347)
- **Worktree creation under a parent branch gave a generic "Failed to create worktree" message.** When a flat branch `test` already exists and the user requests `test/add-unit-coverage`, git refuses with `fatal: 'refs/heads/test' exists; cannot create 'refs/heads/test/add-unit-coverage'`. `parseWorktreeError` now matches this specific shape and reports `Branch <parent> already exists and blocks <nested>` with the suggestion to pick a non-nested name or delete the parent branch first. (#347)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-24

### Internals
- **Unified `Executor<TState>` contract.** New interface in `src/operations/executors/types.ts` formalizes what `MessageManager` actually relies on: `getState` / `reset` required, `handleReaction` / `serialize` optional. `BaseExecutor<T>` implements it. A new `contract.test.ts` iterates every executor and asserts the shape — catches drift when someone adds an executor without the required members. (#346)
- **Uniform `handleReaction` signature across all seven reaction executors** — `(postId, emoji, user, action, ctx) => Promise<boolean>`. Previously `TaskList`, `Subagent`, and `WorktreePrompt` had slightly different shapes. `MessageManager.handleReaction` now dispatches via a `reactionDispatchList()` table instead of an if/else chain. (#346)
- **`MessageManager.serialize()` aggregates executor state** for `SessionManager.persistSession`. The writer no longer reaches into individual executors via named getters (`getTaskListState()`, `getPendingContextPrompt()`). Legacy getters kept as `@deprecated` shims — they still have non-persistence consumers. (#346)
- **Byte-identical `sessions.json` guarantee.** New snapshot tests in `manager.test.ts` pin the full payload's field set and run the new and legacy (`CLAUDE_THREADS_SERIALIZE_V2=0`) paths through a parity assertion. No persisted-schema change on disk. (#346)
- **Rollback hatch:** `CLAUDE_THREADS_SERIALIZE_V2=0` falls back to the pre-refactor per-getter writer for one release. Removed in the next minor. (#346)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Three-way permission modes** — `default` | `auto` | `bypass`. Claude CLI 2.1.x introduced a classifier-based `auto` permission mode; claude-threads now exposes it alongside the historical `default` (MCP-prompt-everything) and `bypass` (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) modes. Set via `permissionMode` in `config.yaml`, the `--permission-mode` CLI flag, or the `!permissions default|auto|bypass` in-session command (legacy `interactive`/`skip` aliases still work). Onboarding wizard now picks `auto` as the recommended default. UI toggle key `[p]` cycles through the three modes. (#343)
- **Security hardening: MCP config via owner-only tempfile** — the Claude subprocess's MCP permission config contains the bot's platform token. It used to be passed inline on `--mcp-config` argv, exposing the token in `ps`. Now written to a mode-`0600` tempfile and passed by path; cleaned up on Claude exit. Gated by `CLAUDE_THREADS_MCP_CONFIG_INLINE=1` rollback flag for one release. (#342)
- **Audit log for rejected reactions** — `SessionManager.handleReaction` now emits a structured `reaction.rejected` event when the allowlist check drops a reaction. Observable signal for probing attempts without changing enforcement behavior. (#342)
- **Bounded aggregate stderr cap across `ClaudeCli` instances** — per-instance 10KB cap stays; under aggregate pressure (>10MB) instances trim to 1KB so a runaway fleet cannot dominate the bot's heap. (#342)
- **Tunable `flushDelayMs`** — streaming cadence (default 500ms) is now configurable via `limits.flushDelayMs` in `config.yaml`. (#342)

### Changed
- **Onboarding and UI speak the three-mode language.** The wizard question changed from `Require approval for Claude actions? (Y/n)` to a three-way picker, defaulting to `auto`. The keyboard `[p]erms` indicator in the footer cycles default → auto → bypass with color-coded severity (green/yellow/red) instead of a green/gray on/off chip.
- **`!permissions` command accepts all three modes** plus legacy aliases. `!permissions interactive` → `default`; `!permissions skip` → `bypass`. The confirmation post shows the canonical mode name and a one-sentence description of what it does.
- **Sticky message and session header** show the three-mode chip (`🔐 Default`, `⚡ Auto`, `⚠️ Bypass`) consistently. Previously the sticky used `⚡ Auto` to mean bypass.

### Deprecated
- **`skipPermissions: boolean` in platform config** — keeps working as an alias. `permissionMode: 'default'|'auto'|'bypass'` is the new canonical field. Precedence: `permissionMode` wins when both are set. (#343)
- **`--skip-permissions` / `--no-skip-permissions` CLI flags** — kept as aliases for `--permission-mode bypass` / `--permission-mode default`. (#343)

### Fixed
- **`content.ts` thread log lost exception text on updatePost failure** — the refactor that collapsed five try/catch blocks into a `tryUpdatePost` helper in #342 dropped the `error: String(err)` field from the flush-path thread log. Restored. (#342)
- **`!permissions <mode>` right after session start aborted Claude** with `No conversation found with session ID`. The respawn paths hardcoded `--resume`, but pre-first-turn sessions have no conversation to resume. Now gated on `session.lifecycle.hasClaudeResponded`. Same fix applied to plugin install/uninstall respawn. (#345)
- **`!help` showed stale `!permissions interactive\|skip`** with a pipe that rendered as the literal `\|` inside a Mattermost markdown table. Registry updated to `default / auto / bypass` (no table-breaking pipe) with a three-mode description. (#345)
- **Session header kept showing the bot-wide mode after `!permissions auto`** — Claude respawned with the correct flag but the session object didn't track the override, so the header read bot-wide. Added `Session.permissionModeOverride` and a single `effectivePermissionMode` helper that all call sites (header, `isSessionInteractive`, respawn on `!cd`/plugin/worktree) now route through. (#345)

### Removed
- **`src/mattermost/api.ts`** — the standalone REST helpers folded into `src/platform/mattermost/permission-api.ts` (only consumer). Net removal: 194 lines of code + 459 lines of redundant tests; equivalent HTTP-level coverage now lives in `src/platform/mattermost/client.test.ts`. (#342)
- **`src/config.ts`** — 37 lines of re-exports. `src/config/migration.ts` renamed to `src/config/index.ts` so the config module's entry point reflects what it actually is. (#342)
- **Internal `skipPermissions` shadow fields** — removed from `SessionConfig`, `ClaudeCliOptions`, `StickyMessageConfig`, and a private `SessionManager` getter once the new `permissionMode` was plumbed end-to-end. (#343)

### Internals
- **Test coverage floor raised** before the structural refactors above. New test files for MCP permission server, plugin handler, Mattermost client, and permission-API helpers. Existing `lifecycle.test.ts` and `manager.test.ts` expanded for branch coverage. Totals: 1970 → 2101 tests (+131). Coverage on `src/mcp/permission-server.ts`: 0% → 80% lines; `src/operations/plugin/handler.ts`: 0% → 100% funcs; `src/session/lifecycle.ts`: 21% → 31% lines. (#341)
- **Small testability refactor in `src/mcp/permission-server.ts`** — extracted `handlePermissionWith()` so the permission flow is unit-testable without spinning up the real `PermissionApi` or reading `process.env` at module load. No behavior change. (#341)
- **5 try/catch blocks in `src/operations/executors/content.ts`** collapsed into a `tryUpdatePost` helper with `onSuccess`/`onFailure` callbacks — keeps the three distinct failure-state reset variants explicit via callbacks rather than hiding them. (#342)
- **DRY permission-mode helpers**: `permissionModeDisplay`, `permissionModeDescription`, and `effectivePermissionMode` live in `src/config/types.ts` as single sources of truth. A `MODE_INFO: Record<PermissionMode, …>` table backs the display + description helpers. The original `permissionModeForRestart` helper was introduced in #343 and then collapsed into `effectivePermissionMode` in #345 once the precedence logic for "respawn mode" and "current effective mode" had converged. (#343, #345)

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Duplicate `claude.sendMessage()` on every session start** — `lifecycle.startSession()` was misreading `offerContextPrompt`'s return contract: the helper returns `false` after sending the message itself in the auto-include / no-context branches, but `lifecycle.ts` interpreted that as "didn't send, please send" and fired a duplicate. Every session start was sending the user's prompt to Claude twice. Net effect on production: ~2× the API turns at session start. Fix: trust the helper's return contract and don't double-send. (#340)
- **Listener leak on `disconnect()`** — `disconnect()` was synchronous: it called `ws.close()` and returned, but EventEmitter listeners stayed attached. Any in-flight `'message'` event the WebSocket queued just before close still fired the bot's `startSession`. Mostly invisible in production (shutdown paths don't reconnect immediately) but caused integration test bots to receive duplicate session-start events during back-to-back test transitions. `disconnect()` now removes all event listeners before closing, and returns `Promise<void>` resolving when the close handshake completes (1s safety timeout). Production callers in shutdown paths can fire-and-forget; tests can `await`. (#340)
- **Integration test flake (~30-40% pass-rate gap)** — multiple root causes addressed:
  - Each integration-test bot now uses its own Mattermost user account from a 4-bot pool. Previously all test bots shared one token, so transient overlapping `disconnect()` / `connect()` windows delivered the same WebSocket events to multiple bots, producing duplicate session starts.
  - Each pool bot uses a unique `platformId`. Module-level state in `src/operations/sticky-message/handler.ts` (a `Map<platformId, postId>`) was conflating bots when they all shared `platformId='test-mattermost'`, causing 403 permission errors on cross-bot post operations.
  - Test helper `MattermostTestApi` now retries 500s with exponential backoff (mirroring the production client). Mattermost throws transient 500s on `/posts` due to a residual `pq: duplicate key` race even on 10.11.15; the test fixture used to throw on the first one.
  - `bot.stop()` now awaits the WebSocket close handshake instead of a fixed sleep.
  - CI workflow `--timeout` aligned with `package.json` script (`120000`); the previous hardcoded `60000` silently overrode test-level timeouts. (#340)

### Changed
- **`PlatformClient.disconnect()` is now `Promise<void>`** instead of `void`. Existing callers in `src/index.ts` and `src/message-handler.ts` are shutdown paths that fire-and-forget; the change is source-compatible (the returned Promise can be ignored). (#340)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking
- **Minimum Node.js bumped from 18 to 20.** Required by `@hono/node-server@2`. Node 18 has been past end-of-life since April 2025, so most installs are already on 20+. (#335)

### Fixed
- **Plain reply could no longer resume a paused session after bot restart** — when the bot restarted more than 2× `sessionTimeoutMinutes` after a session's last activity, `cleanStale()` soft-deleted the paused record. The reply-resume path used `load()` (which hides soft-deleted sessions), so a user reply in the thread promised by the timeout message (`send a new message to continue`) fell through to the `Mention me with your request` branch and a subsequent @mention started a fresh session, losing thread context. The 🔄 reaction path never had this problem because it reads raw data via `findByPostId`. The two resume paths now share the same visibility into the 3-day history window. (#336, thanks @shaders)
- **Flaky `MAX_SESSIONS Limit` integration test** — the Mattermost docker container in CI throws transient 500s on `/posts` that trigger ~1.5s of retry backoff per call. Six sequential session starts under that overhead pushed at least one `waitForSessionActive` past its 10s deadline ~30-50% of runs. The test now uses a 20s per-step budget under `CI`. The race the test guards (`maxSessions` cap, fixed in v1.7.1 / #331) is unchanged. (#337)

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — `@hono/node-server` 1.19.14 → 2.0.0 (#335), `eslint` 10.2.0 → 10.2.1, `prettier` 3.8.2 → 3.8.3, `typescript` 6.0.2 → 6.0.3, `typescript-eslint` 8.58.2 → 8.59.0 (#334).

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Interactive users silently demoted to headless when `autoUpdate` was enabled** — the auto-restart daemon runs the child as a bash background job (`&`), which leaves stdout piped and stdin detached. Ink can't render there, so the TUI dropped out without any error. Three prior patches (#287, #300, #317) each fixed the active crash mode inside the daemon path; none questioned whether interactive users should be routed through the daemon at all. The daemon is now skipped when `process.stdout.isTTY` and `--headless` isn't set. Unattended paths (explicit `--auto-restart`, `--headless`, or no TTY) still go through the daemon. (#333)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Pass `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=true` to the Claude child** — caps `--mcp-config` connects at 5s so a slow MCP server never delays session startup. Requires Claude CLI 2.1.89+. Set it explicitly in the bot's own env to override.
- **Pass `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=true` to the Claude child** — opts into the 1-hour prompt cache TTL, meaningfully reducing re-caching cost on long-lived threads that idle past the default 5-minute window. Requires Claude CLI 2.1.108+. Set it explicitly in the bot's own env to override.
- **Documented `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB=1`** as an opt-in hardening flag. When set on the bot's env it passes through to Claude, which strips the specific credential env vars `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` from any Bash, hook, or stdio MCP subprocess it spawns (empirically verified on CLI 2.1.116). Bot-specific vars like `PLATFORM_TOKEN` / `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` / `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` pass through untouched. **Side effect:** the flag also forces Claude's permission mode to `default` and rejects `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; the bot now warns at startup if the flag is set alongside any platform configured with `skipPermissions: true`. Requires Claude CLI 2.1.83+.

### Fixed
- **Stale Claude CLI version range in `CLAUDE.md`** — the docs said `>=2.0.74 <=2.0.76`, but the actual pin in `version-check.ts` has been `>=2.0.74 <2.2.0` since v1.x. Also bumped the "install a compatible version" hint in the runtime error from `@2.1.1` to `@2.1.116`.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **`maxSessions` cap could be exceeded under concurrent session starts** — `startSession()` passed the cap check synchronously but then awaited `createPost()` before committing the session to the map, so concurrent starts all read the same stale count and over-admitted. The integration test `"should reject new session when at capacity"` flaked at ~40% for weeks because of this. Pending starts are now tracked alongside committed sessions in the cap check. (#331)
- **Reject Claude accounts with both `home` and `apiKey` set** — the two are documented as mutually exclusive, but `AccountPool` silently preferred `home` when both were configured. Now the account is dropped with a warning so misconfiguration surfaces. (#330, thanks @shaders)
- **Tighten `reset_at` epoch regex in rate-limit detection** — the old pattern matched `"preset": N` and (more importantly) `reset_after=N`, a *relative* retry-after hint that would have been misread as an absolute epoch and pushed cooldown decades into the future. Added word-boundary anchors and regression tests. (#330)
- **Rate-limit emit guard now allows deadline extensions** — the boolean latch in `ClaudeCli` fired at most once per process, so a second rate-limit hit with a longer reset time couldn't widen `AccountPool.markCooling`'s extend-only window. Replaced with a numeric last-deadline tracker: repeat hits at the same severity still dedupe, but a later deadline re-emits. (#330)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Multi-account Claude support (opt-in)** — configure a pool of Claude accounts in `config.yaml` so sessions round-robin across multiple subscriptions / API keys and stop sharing one token budget. Each Claude CLI spawn runs with an overridden `HOME` (for OAuth Pro/Max accounts) or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Persisted sessions remember which account they were started on and resume under the same one. Omitting `claudeAccounts` leaves the bot in single-account mode — zero change for existing installs. (#328, thanks @shaders)
- **Rate-limit detection & auto-reassignment** — the bot parses Claude's stderr and result events for rate-limit signals (`usage limit reached`, `rate_limit_error`, `429 ... rate limit`, `quota exceeded`) and puts the offending account into cooldown until the extracted reset time (with a 1-hour fallback). A heads-up is posted in the session thread so the user knows which account is cooling. (#328)
- **Session header & sticky-message account indicators** — the per-session header shows `🔑 Claude account` when multi-account mode is active, and the channel sticky summarizes the pool: `🔑 N accounts` or `🔑 A/N accounts (K cooling)`. (#328)

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Skipped file attachments are now surfaced on session start** - When a user starts a session with an unsupported file (e.g. `.xlsx`), the bot posts the `⚠️ Some files could not be processed` warning instead of silently dropping it. The same warning now fires on the mid-thread context-prompt and worktree paths. (#325, thanks @shaders)
- **Recognize `.har` and `.log` as text** - Both extensions come through as `application/octet-stream` via Mattermost/Slack and were previously dropped as unsupported. (#325)

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **MCP server path resolution in bundled builds** - Fixes `__dirname` resolution when the project is bundled with `bun build` into a single `dist/index.js` (#316)
- **CLAUDE_THREADS_INTERACTIVE forwarding to daemon subprocess** - Parent no longer falsely advertises a TTY to the piped-stdio child in daemon mode (#312, #317)
- **Sticky message test regex** - Updated to match the actual header format (#319)
- **Flaky permissions integration test** - Uses pattern-based waits instead of fixed post counts to tolerate intermittent CI 500s (#320)

### Added
- **Windows compatibility** - Process spawning now works on Windows via Git Bash or WSL (#295)

### Fixed

- **Session store crash on malformed file** - `sessions.json` containing `{}` or missing fields no longer crashes; `loadRaw()` validates structure defensively (#258, #284)
- **!stop ignored in paused sessions** - `!stop`/`!cancel` commands now work in paused sessions instead of being passed as prompts (#258, #285)

  - Generates work summary using haiku before switching contexts
  - `!cd`: Shows summary in context prompt for user selection
  - `!worktree` mid-session: Auto-includes work summary and all thread context

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-16

  - Format: `[Message from @guest_user, approved by @session_owner]`

### Fixed
- **Root message included in thread context** - Fixed bug where the root message was excluded when starting a session mid-thread (#224)

## [1.0.13] - 2026-01-16

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Check combined content height for streaming split decisions** - Fixed bug where height check only evaluated new content instead of combined content (existing + new), causing "Show More" collapse when total exceeded threshold but new content alone didn't (#212)

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Pre-split tall content for new posts** - Height-aware splitting now also applies when creating new posts, not just when updating existing ones (#211)

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Height-aware message breaking** - Mattermost messages now split based on estimated rendered height (~500px threshold) instead of character count, reducing "Read more" collapsed messages (#210)
  - Code blocks: 18px/line + 32px padding
  - Headers: 32px, Lists/Blockquotes: 24px, Tables: 28px/row
  - Text wrapping estimated at ~90 chars/line

- **Pipe characters in markdown tables** - Fixed escaping of `|` characters in help menu table rows (#200)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-13

### Changed
- **Major architecture refactor** - Consolidated operations module with specialized executors (#199)
  - `MessageManager` now orchestrates all message operations via 9 specialized executors
  - Each executor owns its state: Content, TaskList, QuestionApproval, MessageApproval, Prompt, BugReport, Subagent, System, WorktreePrompt

## [0.62.2] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Message content lost on update** - Fixed race condition where first assistant message content was being overwritten by subsequent content (#197)
  - Root cause: When `result` event triggered `flush()`, it was clearing `currentPostId` synchronously before the async flush completed
  - This caused subsequent flushes to UPDATE the same post with only new content, overwriting the original
  - Fix: Track what content has been posted in `currentPostContent` and combine with new content when updating
  - Now properly defers clearing `currentPostId`, `currentPostContent`, and `pendingContent` until after flush completes

## [0.62.1] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Slack/Mattermost message accumulation** - Fixed bug where `pendingContent` was not cleared after flushing, causing messages to accumulate all previous content (#196)

  - Added race condition protection: content appended during `createPost`/`updatePost` is no longer lost
  - Added comprehensive regression tests for the accumulation bug and race condition scenarios

## [0.62.0] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Worktree aggressive pruning** - Fix multiple bugs causing worktrees to be deleted shortly after creation (#194)
  - `isBranchMerged()` no longer detects new branches as merged (main cause of immediate deletion)
  - Only check for merged branches on worktrees older than 24 hours
  - Added race condition protection for worktrees with session IDs
  - Call `updateWorktreeActivity()` on session activity to prevent long-running sessions from having their worktrees pruned

### Added
- **Unified command registry** - Single source of truth for all commands and reactions (#195)
  - `src/commands/registry.ts` - Central command definitions with categories, audiences, and Claude execution permissions
  - `src/commands/help-generator.ts` - Generates `!help` message from registry
  - `src/commands/system-prompt-generator.ts` - Generates Claude's system prompt from registry
  - `claudeCanExecute` and `returnsResultToClaude` flags to identify which commands Claude can use
  - Help message and system prompt are now always in sync

## [0.58.0] - 2026-01-10

### Improved
- **More stable session titles** - Titles now stay consistent throughout the session by anchoring on the original task rather than constantly changing based on recent messages (#189)
  - Original task is used as the PRIMARY anchor for title generation
  - Recent context only matters if the session focus fundamentally changed
  - Existing title is preserved unless there's a major direction shift

- **Slack link previews disabled** - Sticky messages and task posts no longer show link unfurls on Slack
- **Jump-to-bottom links include bot posts** - Links now correctly scroll to the latest message including bot's own posts
- **Flaky integration tests** - Fixed timing issues in multi-user and session limit tests

## [0.37.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Jump to bottom of thread** - Sticky message links now include `?scrollTo=bottom` parameter to jump directly to the latest messages in threads
- **Pause/shutdown status in pinned message** - Channel sticky message now shows when platforms are paused or shutting down with visual indicators (⏸️ paused, 🛑 shutting down)

### Changed
- **Improved spinner animations** - Different spinner styles for different contexts:
  - Braille spinner for typing indicator
  - Dots spinner for session starting
  - Arc spinner for general loading states

### Fixed
- **Code block rendering when messages are split** - Continuation markers (`*... (continued below)*`) now use platform-specific formatting, fixing broken code blocks on Slack
- **Worktree creation failures** - Better error handling when worktree already exists or creation fails:
  - Inline `on branch X` syntax now detects existing worktrees and offers to join them
  - Creation failures now show helpful error messages instead of crashing

## [0.36.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Platform toggle from UI** - Use `Shift+1-9` to toggle platforms on/off from the terminal UI:
  - When disabled: active sessions are paused, platform disconnects, UI shows gray state
  - When re-enabled: platform reconnects, paused sessions auto-resume
  - Visual feedback in StatusLine with colors (green=connected, gray=disabled, yellow=reconnecting, red=error)
- **Pin active task post** - Task posts are now pinned to the channel for easy access:
  - Pin when task post is created
  - Unpin when all tasks complete or session ends
  - Handles task post "bumping" by unpinning old and pinning new
- **Slack file attachment support** - Fixed bug where Slack messages with image attachments were silently ignored:
  - Now handles `file_share` message subtype correctly
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for Slack file uploads

### Changed
- **Universal markdown formatting** - Added `formatMarkdown()` method to `PlatformFormatter` interface:
  - Claude's responses now render properly on all platforms
  - MattermostFormatter: pass-through (standard markdown)
  - SlackFormatter: converts `**bold**` → `*bold*`, `## headers` → bold, links → Slack format
  - DiscordFormatter: pass-through (standard markdown)

## [0.35.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Slack platform support** - Full Slack integration using Socket Mode for real-time events:
  - Socket Mode WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection
  - All session features work identically to Mattermost (commands, reactions, permissions, etc.)
  - Slack mrkdwn formatting (single `*bold*`, `~strikethrough~`, unicode horizontal rules)
  - User mention translation (`<@U123>` format)
  - File attachment support with authenticated downloads
  - Rate limiting with exponential backoff
  - Message recovery after disconnection
- **Slack integration tests** - Platform-agnostic test framework that runs the same 116 tests against both Mattermost and Slack mock servers
- **Slack mock server** - Full mock implementation of Slack's Socket Mode and Web API for testing
- **Platform initialization logging** - Better diagnostics showing which platforms are connecting

### Changed
- **Platform-agnostic formatters** - All markdown formatting now goes through `PlatformFormatter` interface for cross-platform compatibility
- **Cross-platform regex patterns** - Task list parsing now handles both `**bold**` (Mattermost) and `*bold*` (Slack) formats

### Fixed
- **Slack WebSocket reliability** - Added 30-second connection timeout and proper promise rejection if WebSocket closes before hello event
- **Expected API errors** - `already_pinned` and `no_pin` Slack errors no longer spam logs

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Integration test suite** - Comprehensive end-to-end tests that spawn the actual bot against a real Mattermost instance with a mock Claude CLI. 111 tests covering:
  - Session lifecycle (start, response, end, timeout)
  - Commands (!stop, !escape, !help, !cd, !kill, !permissions)
  - Reaction-based controls (❌ cancel, ⏸️ interrupt)
  - Multi-user collaboration (!invite, !kick, message approval)
  - Session persistence and resume after restart
  - Plan approval and question flows
  - Context prompts for mid-thread starts
  - Git worktree integration
  - Error handling and recovery
  - MAX_SESSIONS limits
  - Task list display
- **CI workflow** - GitHub Actions workflow (`integration.yml`) that:
  - Spins up Mattermost in Docker
  - Creates test users, channels, and bot
  - Runs full integration test suite
  - Collects logs on failure for debugging

### Changed
- **Cleaner production code** - Removed test-specific `triggerReactionHandler()` method from SessionManager. Tests now access private methods via TypeScript cast when needed as a WebSocket fallback.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Ink/React CLI UI** - Complete rewrite of the terminal interface using Ink (React for CLI). Features include:
  - Collapsible session panels with real-time log streaming
  - Header with logo, version, and working directory
  - Platform status indicators (connected/reconnecting)
  - Per-session and global log panels with color-coded levels
  - Spinner animations for typing/starting states
- **Keyboard toggles** - Runtime settings can be changed without restart:
  - `[d]` Debug mode - toggle verbose logging
  - `[p]` Permissions - toggle interactive/auto mode for new sessions
  - `[c]` Chrome - toggle Chrome integration for new sessions
  - `[k]` Keep-alive - toggle system sleep prevention
  - `[1-9]` Toggle session panel expansion
  - `[q]` Quit
- **Comprehensive logging** - Added debug logging throughout the codebase for better observability:
  - Platform layer (API calls, WebSocket events, user lookups)
  - Session layer (streaming, reactions, commands, lifecycle)
  - CLI layer (process spawn, kill, interrupt)
  - Git worktree operations

### Changed
- **Session status tracking** - New `isProcessing` and `hasClaudeResponded` flags for accurate status display (starting → active → idle)
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Added `typecheck` to lint-staged to match CI checks

### Fixed
- **Duplicate log entries** - Removed redundant logging that caused duplicate entries in UI
- **Pre-UI logging** - Version check no longer logs before UI starts (was cluttering terminal)

## [0.33.8] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Session resume broken after v0.33.7** - Fixed migration issue where sessions persisted with the old `timeoutPostId` field name couldn't be resumed after upgrading to v0.33.7. The `timeoutPostId` → `lifecyclePostId` rename now includes a proper migration that converts existing sessions on first load.
- **Defensive defaults for persisted session fields** - Session resume now uses safe defaults for all optional fields, preventing crashes when loading sessions from older versions that may have missing fields. Fields like `sessionAllowedUsers`, `planApproved`, `forceInteractivePermissions`, etc. now gracefully default instead of potentially causing undefined errors.
- **Validate required fields before resume** - Sessions with missing critical fields (`threadId`, `platformId`, `claudeSessionId`, `workingDir`) are now skipped gracefully with a warning instead of crashing.

## [0.33.7] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- **Unified lifecycle post tracking** - Shutdown now uses the same post as timeout/warning, so "Bot shutting down" → "Session resumed" updates a single post instead of creating multiple.
- **Renamed `timeoutPostId` to `lifecyclePostId`** - Better reflects its use across the full session lifecycle (warning → timeout → shutdown → resume).

## [0.33.6] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- **Duo post repurposing** - Reduced thread noise by updating posts instead of creating new ones for paired events:
  - Compaction: "🗜️ Compacting..." updates to "✅ Context compacted" (single post)
  - Timeout lifecycle: Warning → Timeout → Resume all update the same post
- **DRY refactor** - Added `resetSessionActivity()` helper to clear duo-post IDs on activity, preventing stale post updates in long threads.

## [0.33.5] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Task toggle emoji disappearing on uncollapse** - Fixed issue where the task toggle emoji (📋) would disappear when uncollapsing the task list. Added re-add of toggle emoji after expanding tasks.
- **Status bar cleanup** - Removed redundant session count from status bars, added keep-alive indicator to show connection health.

## [0.33.4] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Graceful shutdown now actually waits** - Fixed issue where Ctrl-C would exit immediately instead of waiting for Claude CLI processes to exit gracefully. The `kill()` method now returns a Promise that resolves when the process exits, and shutdown waits for all sessions to complete (up to 2 seconds per session).
- **Signal handlers now work correctly** - Fixed conflict with `when-exit` package (transitive dependency via `update-notifier`) that was intercepting SIGINT before our handlers could run. Now removes conflicting handlers before registering our own.
- **No more reconnection attempts during shutdown** - WebSocket client now tracks intentional disconnects and skips reconnection attempts when shutting down gracefully.

## [0.33.3] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Graceful shutdown sends two SIGINTs** - Claude CLI requires two Ctrl+C presses to exit in interactive mode. Updated kill() to send two SIGINTs (100ms apart) before falling back to SIGTERM after 2 seconds.

## [0.33.2] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Session resume "No conversation found" errors** - Fixed issue where cancelled sessions would fail to resume with "No conversation found with session ID" error. Root cause: sessions were persisted before Claude had a chance to save the conversation.
- **Graceful session termination** - When killing a session (cancel, !stop, etc.), Claude now gets 2 seconds to save the conversation (SIGINT then SIGTERM) instead of being killed immediately.
- **Detect invalid session IDs immediately** - Sessions with "No conversation found" errors are now recognized as permanent failures and removed from persistence immediately, instead of retrying 3 times.
- **User notification for early exits** - When a session ends before Claude responds, the user is now notified: "Session ended before Claude could respond. Please start a new session."

### Changed
- **Delayed session persistence** - Sessions are only persisted after Claude has actually responded (first `assistant` or `tool_use` event), preventing dangling session records that can't be resumed.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Recent threads timestamp** - Fixed "just now" showing incorrectly for recent threads. Now displays when the user last worked on the session (`lastActivityAt`) instead of the internal cleanup timestamp (`cleanedAt`).

### Changed
- **Consolidated time formatting** - Unified duplicate `formatRelativeTime` functions into `utils/format.ts`. Added compact `formatRelativeTimeShort()` for sticky message display (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago").

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Compaction status display** - Shows when Claude CLI is compacting context (🗜️ **Compacting context...**) and when it completes (✅ **Context compacted**). Handles `compact_boundary` events with metadata including trigger type and pre-compaction token count.
- **Message recovery after reconnection** - Recovers missed messages after WebSocket disconnections (e.g., machine sleep, network issues). Tracks last processed post ID and fetches missed posts via REST API on reconnect.

### Fixed
- **Timed-out sessions in Recent section** - Fixed bug where timed-out sessions weren't appearing in the "Recent" section of the sticky channel message. Timed-out sessions now show with ⏸️ indicator and a hint to resume via 🔄 reaction.
- **Task toggle emoji behavior** - Changed from flip behavior to state-based: emoji present = expanded, emoji absent = minimized. Added `reaction_removed` event to platform layer.
- **Accurate context token calculation** - Fixed incorrect context token calculation by using `total_input_tokens` from the status line instead of per-request tokens.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Claude CLI version check** - Validates Claude CLI version at startup and exits if incompatible (bypass with `--skip-version-check`). Compatible versions: `>=2.0.74 <=2.0.76`. Version is displayed in terminal startup output, sticky channel message, and session headers.

## [0.31.3] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Clean up stale browser bridge sockets** - Removes stale `claude-mcp-browser-bridge-*` socket files from temp directory before starting Claude CLI. This works around a Claude CLI bug where it tries to `fs.watch()` existing socket files, which fails with `EOPNOTSUPP`. The socket files are left over from previous Chrome integration sessions.

## [0.31.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Detect permanent resume failures immediately** - When resuming a session fails due to Claude CLI's browser bridge temp file issue (EOPNOTSUPP/ENOENT on `claude-mcp-browser-bridge`), the session is now immediately removed from persistence instead of retrying 3 times. This prevents unnecessary retry loops for failures that will never succeed.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Prevent infinite resume retry loop** - Sessions that crash immediately after resume (e.g., due to Claude CLI Chrome MCP issues) now track failure count and are permanently removed after 3 failed attempts, preventing infinite retry loops on bot restart.

### Changed
- **Updated README** - Comprehensive documentation update covering features from v0.8.0 to v0.31.0, including worktree support, context prompts, session history, and more.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Session history retention** - Sessions are now soft-deleted instead of permanently removed when they complete. Session history is kept for display in the sticky message (up to 5 recent sessions). Old history is permanently cleaned up after 3 days.
- **Git branch in session header** - Display the current git branch in the session header table when working in a git repository, providing visibility into which branch the session is operating on.

### Fixed
- **Accurate context usage via status line** - Uses Claude Code's status line feature to get accurate context window usage percentage instead of cumulative billing tokens. Adds a status line writer script that receives accurate per-request token data.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Pull request link detection** - When a session is working in a git worktree with an associated PR, the session header and sticky message now display a clickable link to the PR. Automatically detects PRs from GitHub URLs in branch names or upstream tracking.
- **User existence validation for invite/kick** - The `!invite` and `!kick` commands now validate that the user exists on the platform before attempting the action, providing helpful error messages for non-existent users.

### Fixed
- **Accurate context window usage** - Now uses per-request usage data from Claude's result events instead of cumulative billing tokens, providing accurate context window percentage display.
- **Cancelled sessions no longer resume** - Fixed bug where cancelled sessions (killed by user) would incorrectly resume on bot restart by using the correct composite session key for unpersisting.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-01-03

### Changed
- **Unified SessionContext** - Replaced 4 separate context interfaces (LifecycleContext, EventContext, ReactionContext, CommandContext) with a single unified SessionContext for cleaner module dependencies
- **Centralized error handling** - Added `error-handler.ts` with consistent error patterns across all session modules
- **DRY post helpers** - New `post-helpers.ts` with `postInfo`, `postError`, `postWarning` utilities to reduce code duplication
- **Component-based logging** - Migrated from console.log to `createLogger` utility with component prefixes (`[lifecycle]`, `[events]`, `[commands]`, etc.)
- **Platform-agnostic comments** - Updated code comments to be generic rather than Mattermost-specific

### Added
- **Integration tests** - New integration tests for lifecycle and platform modules
- **Format utilities** - New `src/utils/format.ts` with ID formatting and time/number helpers

## [0.28.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Worktree prompts now show in thread list** - Fixed bug where pending worktree prompts (e.g., "Another session is already using this repo...") weren't displayed in the active threads list. The sticky message now updates immediately when these prompts appear.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Pending prompts in thread list** - The sticky channel message now shows when sessions are waiting for user input. Pending prompts are displayed with visual indicators:
  - 📋 Plan approval - waiting for plan approval reaction
  - ❓ Question X/Y - multi-step questions with progress
  - 💬 Message approval - unauthorized user message pending
  - 🌿 Branch name - waiting for worktree branch input
  - 🌿 Join worktree - asking to join existing worktree
  - 📝 Context selection - choosing thread context to include
- **Reusable pending prompts API** - New `getPendingPrompts()` and `formatPendingPrompts()` functions exported from session module for displaying pending states anywhere

## [0.27.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Context bar crash when tokens exceed context window** - Fixed crash when usage tokens exceeded the context window limit, causing negative remaining tokens and percentage values over 100%
- **Wait for shutdown message before exiting** - Bot now waits for the "session ended" message to be posted before shutting down, ensuring users see the final status

## [0.27.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Version in system prompt** - Claude Code now knows which version of Claude Threads it's running under, enabling version-specific behavior and self-reporting

### Fixed
- **Sticky message status bar layout** - Moved status bar above the "Active Claude Threads" header for better visual hierarchy
- **Shorter status bar** - Removed hostname from status bar to reduce clutter

## [0.26.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Show active task in sticky message** - When Claude is working on tasks, the currently active (in-progress) task is now displayed in the sticky session message. This gives visibility into what Claude is currently working on without scrolling through the thread.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Enhanced system prompt with chat platform context** - Claude Code now receives better context about its environment:
  - Understands it's running as a bot via "Claude Threads" in a chat platform
  - Knows how permissions work (emoji reactions 👍/👎)
  - Aware of available user commands (`!stop`, `!escape`, `!invite`, `!kick`, `!cd`, `!permissions`)
  - Understands multiple users can participate in a session
  - This helps Claude provide better UX by understanding its environment and guiding users about available controls

### Fixed
- **Session title/description markers visible in chat** - Fixed issue where `[SESSION_TITLE: ...]` and `[SESSION_DESCRIPTION: ...]` markers would appear in chat messages when validation failed. Markers are now always stripped from displayed text regardless of validation outcome.
- **Session title/description length validation** - Added maximum length limits (title: 50 chars, description: 100 chars) to prevent overly long metadata from cluttering the session header and sticky message.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Auto-include single-message thread context** - When starting a session in a thread that has only one prior message (the thread starter), it now auto-includes that message as context without prompting. Previously, this would trigger an unnecessary "Include 1 message as context?" prompt with reaction options. Now, single-message context is silently included, while multi-message threads still prompt for confirmation.
- **Worktree branch response excluded from context count** - When a user responds to a worktree branch prompt (e.g., typing "fix/my-branch"), that response is now excluded from the thread context count and messages. Previously, this response was incorrectly counted as conversation context, leading to misleading "Include 2 messages?" prompts when only the original thread starter was meaningful context.
- **Persist sessions before killing on graceful shutdown** - Sessions are now properly persisted before being killed during graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Enhanced session status bar with model and context info** - The session header now displays real-time usage information similar to Claude Code's status line:
  - Model name (`🤖 Opus 4.5`, `🤖 Sonnet 4`, etc.)
  - Context usage with visual progress bar (`🟢▓▓░░░░░░░░ 23%`)
  - Session cost (`💰 $0.07`)
  - Color-coded context indicator:
    - 🟢 Green: < 50% (plenty of context)
    - 🟡 Yellow: 50-75% (moderate usage)
    - 🟠 Orange: 75-90% (getting full)
    - 🔴 Red: 90%+ (almost full)
- **Periodic status bar updates** - Status bar now refreshes every 30 seconds automatically to keep uptime and usage stats current
- **Usage stats tracking** - Session now tracks token usage, cost, and model information extracted from Claude CLI result events

### Improved
- **Existing worktree handling** - When a worktree already exists for a branch, the bot now offers to join it with a reaction prompt (👍 to join, ❌ to skip) instead of just showing a warning message that required manually typing `!worktree switch`

### Fixed
- **Task list 🔽 emoji not preserved when bumped** - Fixed issues where the collapse/expand toggle emoji would disappear or get stuck on the wrong post:
  - When a task list is bumped to the bottom, the new post now gets the 🔽 emoji via `createInteractivePost`
  - When a task post is repurposed for other content, the emoji is removed from the old post before reuse
  - Added `removeReaction` method to platform client interface for proper emoji cleanup
- **WorktreeMode type inconsistency** - Aligned the WorktreeMode type definition across the codebase to include 'off' mode

## [0.23.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Sticky message status bar** - Added a compact status line to the channel sticky message showing system-level info:
  - Bot version (`v0.22.0`)
  - Active sessions count (`3/5 sessions`)
  - Permission mode (`🔐 Interactive` or `⚡ Auto`)
  - Worktree mode (`🌿 Worktree: always/never`) - only shown if not default 'prompt'
  - Chrome status (`🌐 Chrome`) - only when enabled
  - Debug mode (`🐛 Debug`) - only when enabled
  - Battery level (`🔋 85%` or `🔌 AC`) - macOS and Linux
  - Bot uptime (`⏱️ 2h15m`) - how long the bot has been running
  - Working directory (`📂 ~/projects`)
  - Hostname (`💻 hostname`) - machine name for identification

## [0.22.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Missing `diff` dependency** - Added missing `diff` package that was used in tool-formatter but not in package.json
- **Test console output pollution** - Suppressed expected console output in tests (error handling, keep-alive messages)
- **Lint warning in sticky-message** - Removed non-null assertion in favor of proper undefined check

## [0.22.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Session status bar** - Compact status line between logo and table showing at-a-glance info:
  - Session slots (`1/5`)
  - Permission mode (`🔐 Interactive` or `⚡ Auto`)
  - Chrome status (`🌐 Chrome`) - only when enabled
  - Keep-alive status (`💓 Keep-alive`) - only when active
  - Battery level (`🔋 85%` or `🔌 AC`) - macOS and Linux
  - Session uptime (`⏱️ 5m`, `1h23m`, etc.)

### Changed
- **Slimmer session header table** - Moved session slots, permissions, and Chrome status to the status bar, keeping only contextual info (topic, directory, participants, etc.) in the table

### Fixed
- **Task list collapse toggle not working** - Fixed a bug where clicking the 🔽 emoji to collapse/expand the task list had no effect. The task post ID was not being registered in the reaction routing index, causing all toggle reactions to be silently ignored. Now the task post is properly registered in all scenarios: initial creation, session resume, and after being bumped to the bottom of the thread.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Subagent layout issue** - Fixed a bug where starting a subagent could create an empty or near-empty message above the task list, causing a broken layout. The fix ensures pending content is flushed before posting subagent status messages.
- **Session title/description not generated after worktree creation** - When a session started with a worktree prompt, the system prompt instructing Claude to generate session metadata was not passed to the restarted Claude CLI in the new worktree directory
- **Code block continuations now preserve formatting** - When a message needs to split mid-way through a code block (diff, typescript, etc.), the code block is now properly closed in the first part and reopened in the continuation
  - Prevents broken markdown when long diffs or code blocks exceed message length limits
  - Adds `getCodeBlockState()` helper to detect when we're inside an unclosed code block
  - `findLogicalBreakpoint()` now avoids breaking inside code blocks when possible
  - When a break inside a code block is unavoidable, properly closes with ``` and reopens with ```language

## [0.21.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Session title/description in thread header** - The session header table now displays the topic and summary at the top, providing immediate context within the thread itself
- **Periodic metadata reminders** - Every 5 user messages, Claude receives a reminder to update the session title/description if the topic has evolved, ensuring metadata stays current as conversations progress

### Changed
- **Dynamic header updates** - Session header now updates automatically when Claude generates or changes the title/description

### Fixed
- **Session title/description validation** - Reject placeholder values like "..." that Claude sometimes generates instead of real titles/descriptions

## [0.20.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Sticky message improvements** - Enhanced the channel sticky message with active sessions
  - Shows display name in bold (e.g., **Anne**) instead of username
  - Added session description below the title (generated by Claude)
  - Added install hint: `npm i -g claude-threads` in footer
  - Periodic refresh every 60 seconds to keep relative times current
  - Auto-cleanup of old sticky messages from failed runs at startup

### Fixed
- **Sticky message updates on session end** - Message now updates when sessions are:
  - Canceled via `!stop` or ❌ reaction
  - Paused/interrupted via `!escape` or ⏸️ reaction
  - Killed due to timeout
  - Failed to start or resume
- **Race condition in sticky updates** - Added mutex to prevent duplicate sticky posts when multiple updates happen concurrently

## [0.19.2] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Smart message breaking** - Breaks long responses into multiple messages at logical points
  - Reduces "Show More" toggles in Mattermost by breaking messages before they get too long
  - Breaks at logical points: after tool completions, before headings, after code blocks, at paragraph breaks
  - Soft threshold at 2000 chars / 15 lines triggers search for breakpoints
  - Hard threshold at 14K chars ensures messages stay within platform limits
  - Adds `*... (continued below)*` marker when breaking messages

### Fixed
- **Task list stays below subagent messages** - Task list now bumps to bottom when subagents start
  - Previously, subagent status messages would appear below the task list
  - Now the task list correctly repositions itself below subagent posts

## [0.19.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Task list collapse emoji now pre-added** - The 🔽 toggle emoji is now automatically added as a reaction when the task list is created, making it easy to click and collapse/expand the list (previously users had to manually add the emoji)
- **Improved thinking trace display** - Better formatting for extended thinking blocks
  - Use blockquote format (`> 💭 *...*`) for cleaner visual separation
  - Increased preview length from 100 to 200 characters
  - Cut at word boundaries instead of mid-word for cleaner truncation

## [0.19.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Minimize/expand task list** - Toggle task list visibility with emoji reactions
  - React with 🔽 (`arrow_down_small`) or 🔻 (`small_red_triangle_down`) on the task list to toggle
  - Minimized view shows: `📋 **Tasks** (2/5 · 40%) · 🔄 Current task 🔽`
  - Expanded view shows full task list with all items
  - State persists across session restarts
  - Similar to Ctrl-T in Claude Code CLI

### Changed
- **Unified CLI output styling** - Consistent 2-space indented output with emoji prefixes
  - Created centralized `src/utils/output.ts` module with shared color helpers
  - Keep-alive messages now use `☕ Sleep prevention active (caffeinate)` format instead of `[keep-alive]` prefix
  - All files now import colors from the shared module instead of defining locally

## [0.18.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Keep-alive support** - Prevents system sleep while Claude sessions are active
  - Automatically starts when first session begins, stops when all sessions end
  - Cross-platform: macOS (`caffeinate`), Linux (`systemd-inhibit`), Windows (`SetThreadExecutionState`)
  - Enabled by default, disable with `--no-keep-alive` CLI flag or `keepAlive: false` in config
  - Shows `☕ Keep-alive enabled` in startup output
- **Resume timed-out sessions via emoji reaction** - React with 🔄 to the timeout message or session header to resume a timed-out session
  - Timeout message now shows resume hint: "💡 React with 🔄 to resume, or send a new message to continue."
  - Resume also works by sending a new message in the thread (existing behavior)
  - Session header now displays truncated session ID for reference
  - Supports multiple resume emojis: 🔄 (arrows_counterclockwise), ▶️ (arrow_forward), 🔁 (repeat)

### Fixed
- **Sticky task list**: Task list now correctly stops being sticky when all tasks are completed
  - Previously, the task list stayed at the bottom even after all tasks had `status: 'completed'`
  - Now properly detects when all tasks are done using `todos.every(t => t.status === 'completed')`

## [0.17.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Sticky task list optimization**: Completed task lists no longer move to the bottom
  - Once all tasks are done, the "~~Tasks~~ *(completed)*" message stays in place
  - Reduces unnecessary message deletions and recreations
  - Added `tasksCompleted` flag to session state for explicit tracking

### Changed
- **Task list visual separator**: Added horizontal rule (`---`) above task list for better visibility

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Sticky task list** - Task list now stays at the bottom of the thread
  - When Claude posts new content, the task list moves below it
  - When you send a follow-up message, the task list moves below your message
  - Task list updates in place without visual noise
  - Mirrors Claude Code CLI behavior where tasks are always at the bottom

### Fixed
- **Context prompt after restart**: Context prompt now appears after session restarts (worktree creation, `!cd`)
  - Previously, after worktree creation or directory change, the context prompt was skipped
  - Now users can include thread history when Claude restarts in a new directory
  - Added `needsContextPromptOnNextMessage` flag for deferred context prompt (after `!cd`)

## [0.16.8] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Context prompt**: Fixed context prompt appearing when starting a session with the first message in a thread
  - The triggering message was incorrectly included in the count, making it show "1 message before this point" when there were none

## [0.16.7] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Session resume**: Validate working directory exists before resuming sessions after restart
  - Prevents crashes when a worktree or directory has been deleted

## [0.16.6] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Worktree context**: Replay first user prompt after mid-session worktree creation (`!worktree create`)
- **Thread context prompt**: When starting a session mid-thread (replying to an existing thread), offers to include previous conversation context
  - Shows options for last 3, 5, or 10 messages (only options that make sense for available message count)
  - "All X messages" option when message count doesn't match standard options
  - 30-second timeout defaults to no context
  - Context is prepended to the initial prompt so Claude understands the conversation history

### Fixed
- **Plan mode approval**: Fixed API error "unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks" when approving plans
  - Claude Code CLI handles ExitPlanMode internally; changed to send user message instead of duplicate tool_result
- **Question reactions**: Fixed 2nd+ questions not responding to emoji reactions
  - Follow-up question posts weren't registered for reaction routing
- **Question answering**: Fixed duplicate tool_result when answering AskUserQuestion
  - Claude Code CLI handles AskUserQuestion internally; changed to send user message
- Session timeout warning showing negative minutes (e.g., "-24min")
- Warning now fires 5 minutes before timeout instead of after 5 minutes idle
- Stale sessions are now cleaned from persistence on startup

## [0.11.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Fix worktree and `!cd` crash** - Claude CLI sessions are tied to working directory
  - Can't use `--resume` when switching directories (session ID is directory-specific)

  - Consistent with plan approval and message approval behavior

## [0.10.10] - 2025-12-28

## [0.10.7] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Fixed `!context` and `!cost` commands** - These commands now properly display output
  - Claude Code slash commands (`/context`, `/cost`) output via `user` events with `<local-command-stdout>` tags
  - Added handling for these events so the output is displayed in Mattermost

## [0.10.6] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

  - Now session is preserved and user can send a new message to continue
  - Works with both ⏸️ reaction and `!escape`/`!interrupt` commands
- **Filter `<thinking>` tags from output** - Claude's internal thinking is no longer shown to users
  - Previously `<thinking>...</thinking>` tags would appear literally in Mattermost messages

## [0.10.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **`!kill` now works from any message** - previously only worked within active session threads
  - Can now send `!kill` or `@bot !kill` as the very first message to emergency shutdown

### Fixed
- **Fix plan mode getting stuck after approval** - tool calls now get proper responses
  - `ExitPlanMode` and `AskUserQuestion` now receive `tool_result` instead of user messages
  - Claude was waiting for tool results that never came, causing sessions to hang
  - Added `toolUseId` tracking to `PendingApproval` interface

## [0.9.3] - 2025-12-28
