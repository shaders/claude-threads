/**
 * AccountPool — usage-balancing selector over a pool of Claude accounts.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Hand out an account for a new session, preferring whichever account has the
 *   most subscription headroom (lowest `/usage` load score), skipping accounts
 *   in rate-limit cooldown. Usage figures are probed on-demand at new-session
 *   start (see `usage-probe.ts` / `SessionManager.refreshAccountUsage`) and fed
 *   in via `setUsage()`.
 * - Track which accounts are currently in rate-limit cooldown so future sessions
 *   route around them. Resume of existing sessions bypasses cooldown because the
 *   conversation history lives under that account's HOME and can't be moved.
 * - Track usage counts / percentages for UI display (sticky message).
 *
 * Selection for a new session (`balanceByUsage: true`): among non-cooling
 * accounts, pick the lowest usage load score; ties break by fewest active
 * sessions, then round-robin rotation. An account whose usage hasn't been probed yet is
 * treated as maximally loaded so we never route a fresh session onto an account
 * that might already be at its cap — the poller fills real values in shortly
 * after startup, and the active-session tiebreak still spreads load until then.
 *
 * Single-account mode: pass an empty array (or `undefined`) to the constructor
 * and every method returns `null` — the bot then falls back to `process.env` as
 * it does today.
