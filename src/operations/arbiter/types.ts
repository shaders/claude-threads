/**
 * Arbiter types — session completion watchdog.
 *
 * The arbiter watches each turn's completion and intervenes in two cases:
 *
 * 1. Forgotten deliveries: the user asked for an external deliverable
 *    ("when done, reply to ~channel / DM @person / send the file") but the
 *    agent finished the turn without ever calling the delivery tool.
 *    Detection is deterministic (was the tool called or not).
 *
 * 2. Stalls: the agent ended its turn asking permission to continue
 *    ("should I keep looking?", "want me to proceed?") instead of doing the
 *    work. With nobody watching the thread, the task silently stops.
 *    Detection is a cheap LLM verdict over the turn's final message.
